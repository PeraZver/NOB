## Operations

The 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade was formed on December 21, 1941, in Rudo, following a decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and under the leadership of the Supreme Commander of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito. Initially composed of six battalions, the brigade embarked on a significant military campaign throughout World War II, covering over 20,000 kilometers and involving more than 22,000 fighters from across Yugoslavia.

### Early Operations and Eastern Bosnia

The brigade's first combat occurred on December 22, 1941, near the villages of Gaočić and Mioče, an event later celebrated as the Day of the Yugoslav People's Army. By the end of December 1941, the brigade, along with the Supreme Headquarters, moved into Eastern Bosnia. During the Second Enemy Offensive from January 17 to 23, 1942, the brigade engaged in multiple battles, including those at Pjenovac, near Rogatica, Vareš, Han Pijesak, and Bijele Vode. The brigade notably executed a march over the Igman mountain in extreme cold, demonstrating remarkable resilience.

### Campaign in Bosanska Krajina

On June 24, 1942, the brigade joined the Proletarian Shock Group in a campaign in Bosanska Krajina. This operation included battles along the Sarajevo-Mostar railway, the liberation of Konjic on August 8, 1942, and engagements around Bugojno, Duvno, and Šujica, culminating in the liberation of Livno. The brigade also participated in the liberation of Ključ on October 7, 1942, and fought against Chetnik and Italian forces around Bosansko Grahovo.

### Integration into the 1st Proletarian Division

On November 1, 1942, the brigade became part of the 1st Proletarian Division. It received the proletarian flag from Josip Broz Tito in Bosanski Petrovac on November 8, 1942. The brigade then conducted operations in central Bosnia, including the destruction of the stronghold at Sitnica and the liberation of Jajce, Skender-Vakuf, Kotor-Varoš, and Teslić.

### Battles of the Neretva and Sutjeska

During the Fourth Enemy Offensive, the brigade executed a six-day march from Banja Luka to the Sarajevo-Mostar railway, engaging in fierce battles at Ivan-saddle and Bradina. It played a crucial role in the counterattack at Gornji Vakuf from March 3 to 5, 1943, and continued to advance towards Kalinovik and Ustikolina, breaking through Chetnik defenses.

In the Battle of the Sutjeska, the brigade initially fought against the 1st German Mountain Division and later protected the Central Hospital near Čelebić. It successfully broke through enemy encirclements on June 10 and 12, 1943, at Zelengora and Kalinovik-Foča, respectively.

### Final Operations and Liberation

In the winter of 1943/1944, the brigade operated around Jajce, Mrkonjić Grad, and Gerzovo. It participated in the Drvar Operation and moved towards Sandžak, engaging in battles on the Vranica, Zec, and Bitovnja mountains. In August 1944, the brigade began its advance into Serbia, liberating Bajina Bašta, Valjevo, and Ub. It played a significant role in the Belgrade Operation and later fought on the Srem Front from December 1944 to April 1945. The brigade's final battle was for the liberation of Zagreb, which it entered on May 9, 1945.

Throughout its operations, the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade suffered over 7,500 casualties but significantly contributed to the liberation efforts, capturing thousands of enemy soldiers and receiving numerous decorations, including the Order of the People's Hero.
