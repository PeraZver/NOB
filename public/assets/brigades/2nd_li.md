## Operations

The 2nd Lika Proletarian Assault Brigade was formed on August 19, 1942, in Laudonov Gaj near Bunić. Initially, it was part of the First Operational Zone of Croatia and consisted of battalions from the Lika Partisan detachments. Shortly after its formation, the brigade attempted an unsuccessful attack on the Ustaše-Domobran garrison in Udbina from August 22 to 24, suffering heavy losses with 285 fighters incapacitated.

On September 14, 1942, the brigade was renamed the 2nd Assault Brigade of Croatia by the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army (NOV) and Partisan Detachments of Croatia. In October, after successful engagements in the Perušić district, the brigade was ordered to move to Kordun, where it incorporated the 1st Lika Youth Women's Company, consisting of 75 young women fighters. The brigade, in collaboration with the 4th Kordun Brigade, defeated an Italian cavalry regiment and the 81st Battalion at Poloj on October 17, earning praise from the Main Staff.

During the Bihać Operation, the brigade liberated several villages and, on November 3, 1942, captured Ličko Petrovo Selo, destroying the 31st Ustaše Battalion. It then pursued the retreating enemy northward and participated in the liberation of Slunj. On November 22, 1942, the brigade became part of the newly formed 6th Lika Division and remained with it until the end of the war.

In late 1942, the brigade returned to Lika, liberating Lovinac on December 25 and, alongside the 1st Lika Assault Brigade, attacked the Italian and Chetnik garrison in Gračac on January 14-15, 1943. The brigade's Assault Battalion distinguished itself by breaking into the town and withstanding numerous assaults before breaking out of encirclement.

The brigade fought fiercely during the Fourth Enemy Offensive on the Lički Osik-Bunić and Vrhovine-Korenica axes. After repelling the offensive, it engaged in successful operations around Gospić and participated in an unsuccessful attack on the town on May 2-3, 1943.

In June 1943, the brigade was sent to the Knin-Vrlika area, where it remained throughout the summer, liberating Kijevo, Vrlika, Maovice, and Štikovo in cooperation with the 10th Krajina Assault Brigade and the Lika Partisan Detachment. It repelled several strong Italian and Chetnik attacks from Knin.

Returning to Lika in September, the brigade continued operations along the Donji Lapac-Gračac route and between Gospić and Gračac. On November 12, 1943, the brigade moved to Bosnia, engaging in battles around Travnik, Zenica, and Šujica against German, Ustaše, and Domobran units.

In early 1944, the brigade was transferred to Drvar to secure the NOV and POJ Supreme Headquarters and disrupt enemy traffic on the Bihać-Donji Lapac-Knin road. On March 19, 1944, the brigade was designated as proletarian, reflecting its elite status.

During the Drvar Operation in May 1944, the brigade conducted defensive operations to prevent German forces from advancing from Srb to Drvar and fought on the Bosanski Petrovac-Drvar road. It later participated in the attack on Livno on July 2-3.

From Glamoč, the brigade, as part of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division "Nikola Tesla," began a march to Serbia on July 20, 1944, engaging in battles at Nemila, on the Bosna River, Sutjeska, and Piva Mountain. Despite being exhausted and weakened, the brigade contributed significantly to defeating Chetnik forces near Užička Požega, Jelova Gora, and Maljen, and participated in the liberation of Valjevo.

In the Belgrade Operation of October 1944, the brigade attacked from the southwest, liberating Ripanj and reaching Topčider before moving to Avala, where it distinguished itself in the destruction of the German 1st Mountain Division. After the liberation of Belgrade, the brigade fought in Srem before returning to Belgrade for rest and replenishment in late November.

In early 1945, the brigade was deployed to the Srem Front, fighting at Nijemci, Mala Vašica, and Ilinci. It participated in breaking through the Srem Front and fought in the liberation of Đakovo, Slavonski Brod, Ilova, Čazma, Zagreb, and Remete. The brigade ended the war by clearing the Zagreb Mountain of remaining enemy units from May 11 to 12, 1945.
