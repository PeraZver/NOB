## Operations

### Formation in Kordun (1942)
The 4th Kordun Assault Brigade was formed on August 20, 1942, in the village of Gornji Budački in the Kordun region of Croatia. The Kordun area, with its rugged terrain and forests, provided an ideal base for partisan operations. The brigade was created from local partisan detachments that had been conducting guerrilla operations against the occupying forces.

The newly formed brigade immediately engaged in operations to secure partisan-controlled territory in Kordun and to disrupt Axis communications and supply routes. Throughout late 1942, the unit conducted numerous successful ambushes and raids against German and Ustasha forces.

### Defensive Operations (1942-1943)
During the winter of 1942-1943, the brigade participated in defensive operations against major Axis offensives aimed at destroying partisan forces in the Kordun region. The unit fought in several significant battles, using its knowledge of local terrain to maximum advantage. Despite facing superior enemy forces, the brigade successfully defended key positions and maintained the partisan presence in the region.

### Expansion Beyond Kordun (1943)
As the partisan movement grew stronger, the 4th Kordun Brigade began operating beyond its home region. In 1943, it participated in operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supporting other partisan units in major battles. The brigade demonstrated its versatility by adapting to different types of terrain and tactical situations.

### Liberation Campaigns (1944-1945)
In 1944 and 1945, the brigade was involved in the liberation campaigns across Croatia. It participated in the liberation of several towns in the Kordun region and surrounding areas. The unit fought in coordination with other partisan brigades to expel German forces from Croatian territory.

### Final Operations
In the final months of the war, the 4th Kordun Assault Brigade continued offensive operations until the German surrender in May 1945. The brigade played a significant role in securing the Kordun region and contributed to the broader liberation of Yugoslavia.

Throughout the war, the brigade maintained strong ties to its home region while serving wherever the partisan command needed it. The unit was recognized for its discipline, fighting spirit, and contributions to the People's Liberation War.
