## Operations

The 16th Banija Assault Brigade was formed on December 26, 1942, in the village of Klasnić, near Glina. It was composed of fighters from the Fourth Battalion of the Seventh Banija Brigade, the Second Battalion of the Eighth Banija Brigade, and the Second Battalion of the Fifteenth Kordun Brigade. At the time of its formation, the brigade had 759 fighters, armed with 505 rifles, 22 light machine guns, and four heavy machine guns. The first commander of the brigade was Vojko Hošteter, and the political commissar was Uroš Slijepčević.

From its inception, the brigade was part of the Seventh Banija Assault Division. It participated in significant operations during the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensives. These operations were critical in the broader context of the Yugoslav Partisan movement's resistance against Axis forces. However, the brigade suffered heavy casualties, losing more than two-thirds of its personnel. Due to these losses, the brigade was disbanded on June 30, 1943. The remaining fighters were integrated into the Seventh and Eighth Banija Brigades.

For its contributions during the National Liberation War, the 16th Banija Assault Brigade was awarded the Order of Merit for the People and the Order of Brotherhood and Unity. In June 1958, on the fifteenth anniversary of the Battle of Sutjeska, the brigade was also honored with the Order of the People's Hero.
