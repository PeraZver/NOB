## Operations

The 2nd Proletarian Assault Brigade was formed on March 1, 1942, in Čajniče and initially consisted of fighters from the Užički, Čačanski, and Second Šumadijski Partisan Detachments. The brigade played a significant role in the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II, covering approximately 24,000 kilometers and engaging in numerous battles across Yugoslavia.

### Early Operations (March 1942 - October 1942)
In its early operations, the brigade was under the direct command of the Supreme Headquarters. It operated in eastern Bosnia, capturing Borike and liberating Vlasenica, Bratunac, Milići, Srebrenica, and Drinjača from Chetnik forces. The brigade also engaged in battles on Romanija and attacked Ustaše strongholds in Rogatica and Han-Pijesak. In April, it participated in an attack on the Ustaše stronghold Borač in Herzegovina.

### Western Bosnia Campaign (June 1942 - October 1942)
On June 24, 1942, the brigade joined the Assault Group of Brigades under the Supreme Commander's direct command and moved into western Bosnia. It fought around Kalinovik, disrupted the Sarajevo-Mostar railway, and captured Tarčin and Pazarić. The brigade also engaged in battles in the Travnik, Donji Vakuf, and Bugojno sectors. It participated in the attack on Kupres and the liberation of Jajce on September 25, 1942. On October 17, the brigade received the Proletarian Flag from Josip Broz Tito in Drvar.

### Neretva and Sutjeska Battles (January 1943 - June 1943)
During the Battle of the Neretva in early 1943, the brigade fought fiercely around Knin and Strmica, and later in the Imotski and Posušje areas. It advanced into the Neretva valley, capturing Drežnica and Grabovo. The brigade was instrumental in breaking through enemy lines and saving wounded Partisans. In the Battle of Sutjeska, the brigade attempted a breakthrough southeast of Foča and engaged in significant battles on Vučevo and Košuta, contributing to the expansion of the breakthrough on Zelengora.

### Operations in Serbia and Montenegro (September 1943 - May 1944)
The brigade moved into Serbia, liberating several towns including Foča, Pljevlja, and Prijepolje. It faced heavy losses in a surprise battle near Prijepolje on December 4, 1943. The brigade continued to fight in Serbia and Sandžak until May 1944, when it was forced to retreat to Montenegro.

### Final Operations and Liberation (June 1944 - April 1945)
In mid-1944, the brigade participated in the Andrijevica operation and fought on the Pešter plateau and the Ibar River. It was active in Kopaonik, Župa, Rasina, and around Kuršumlija, where it excelled in defeating Chetnik forces. The brigade played a notable role in the Belgrade Operation and subsequently operated on the Srem Front until the end of 1944. In early 1945, it participated in battles on the Drina and contributed to the liberation of parts of eastern Bosnia and Slavonia.

The 2nd Proletarian Assault Brigade was highly decorated, receiving the Order of the People's Liberation, the Order of the Partisan Star, the Order of Brotherhood and Unity, and the Order of Bravery. In 1958, it was also awarded the Order of the People's Hero on the fifteenth anniversary of the Battle of Sutjeska.
