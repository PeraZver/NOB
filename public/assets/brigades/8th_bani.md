## Operations

The 8th Banija Assault Brigade, initially formed as the 6th Banija Brigade, was established on September 7, 1942, in the village of Obljaj near Glina. The decision to form the brigade was made by the Headquarters of the First Operational Zone of Croatia, incorporating fighters from the First, Second, and Fourth Battalions of the Banija Partisan Detachment. At its inception, the brigade was equipped with rifles, 17 light machine guns, five heavy machine guns, and 35 pistols.

On September 18, 1942, the brigade was renamed the 8th Banija Brigade by the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Croatia. From November 22, 1942, until the end of the war, it was part of the 7th Banija Assault Division. In September 1943, the brigade was again renamed, becoming the 2nd Brigade of the 7th Banija Assault Division.

The brigade was disbanded on December 6, 1944, with its fighters being transferred to the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Brigades of the 7th Banija Assault Division. Throughout its operational history, the brigade was recognized for its contributions to the National Liberation War, being awarded the Order of Merit for the People and the Order of Brotherhood and Unity. In March 1944, it was designated as an "Assault" brigade, a testament to its effectiveness and bravery in combat.

In recognition of its valor, the brigade was awarded the Order of the People's Hero in June 1958, on the fifteenth anniversary of the Battle of Sutjeska. Despite the disbandment, the legacy of the 8th Banija Assault Brigade endures as a symbol of resistance and heroism during World War II.
