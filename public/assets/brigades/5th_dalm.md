## Operations

The 5th Dalmatian Brigade was initially formed on February 3, 1943, in Bosansko Grahovo, comprising four battalions with a total strength of 550 fighters. It was initially under the command of the 4th Operational Zone of Croatia until February 12, 1943. The brigade was then incorporated into the 9th Dalmatian Division. During the Battle of Neretva, the brigade engaged in combat in the sectors of Imotski, Posušje, and Široki Brijeg. The entire division, including the 5th Dalmatian Brigade, was affected by typhus during the crossing of the Neretva and Prenj.

The brigade was disbanded on April 12, 1943, in Nevesinje, with its personnel largely reinforcing the 3rd Dalmatian Brigade. It was reformed on August 13, 1943, in the village of Plavno near Knin, from units of the Knin sector, initially known as the Knin Brigade and later as the 1st Brigade of the 19th Division of the NOVJ. At this time, it had approximately 1,300 fighters.

In September 1943, the brigade participated in disarming Italian troops in northern Dalmatia and fought against the German 114th Jäger Division. It played a crucial role in maintaining free territory and vital supply routes in northern Dalmatia, resisting significant Axis troop concentrations and frequent offensive attempts.

In December 1943, the brigade defended the free territory around Bosansko Grahovo from the German operation "Citen." In February 1944, it was targeted during operation "Emil" in the Velebit area. During September and October 1944, the brigade took part in offensive actions of its division, contributing to the liberation of Benkovac. It served as the western attack column during the Knin operation, helping to thwart German breakout attempts from the besieged Knin.

In the Lika-Primorje and Trieste operations against the 15th and 97th German Corps, the 19th Division, with the 5th Dalmatian Brigade as part of its central attack column, was forced to break through fortified enemy positions through frontal assaults. The brigade was instrumental in liberating Udbina, Senj, Crikvenica, Kraljevica, and Sušak.

The brigade's final wartime operation was the encirclement and destruction of the 97th German Corps near Ilirska Bistrica. Throughout its service, approximately 4,500 fighters passed through the brigade, with around 900 casualties. The brigade was honored with the Order of Merit for the People with a Golden Star and the Order of Brotherhood and Unity with a Golden Wreath.
