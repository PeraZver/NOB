## Operations

### Early Operations (1942)
The 1st Lika Proletarian Assault Brigade "Marko Orešković" was formed on July 8, 1942, in the village of Tobolić near Slunj, as part of the Croatian Partisan forces during World War II. Named after the fallen commander Marko Orešković who died in April 1942, the brigade quickly became one of the most distinguished units in the People's Liberation Army.

After its formation, the brigade immediately participated in battles against German and Ustasha forces in the Lika region. During the summer of 1942, it fought in several engagements to protect partisan-controlled territory and support the liberation of surrounding areas.

### Battle of Neretva (1943)
The brigade played a crucial role in the Battle of Neretva in early 1943, one of the most significant battles of the Yugoslav Partisan resistance. The unit was tasked with breaking through enemy lines and securing key positions along the Neretva River valley. Despite heavy casualties, the brigade successfully completed its mission and helped ensure the survival of the partisan forces and thousands of wounded fighters.

### Expansion and Further Campaigns (1943-1944)
Following the Battle of Neretva, the brigade was reinforced and reorganized. It participated in numerous operations throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. The unit was involved in the liberation of several important towns and cities, including operations around Bihać, Knin, and later in the final operations in Slovenia.

### Final Operations (1945)
In the spring of 1945, the brigade participated in the final operations to liberate Yugoslavia from German occupation. It fought in the battles for the liberation of Zagreb and continued operations until the end of the war in May 1945.

Throughout its wartime service, the 1st Lika Proletarian Assault Brigade "Marko Orešković" distinguished itself through its combat effectiveness and dedication to the partisan cause. The brigade suffered significant casualties but remained one of the most respected units in the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army. After the war, it was recognized as one of the elite brigades of the National Liberation War.
