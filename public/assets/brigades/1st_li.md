## Operations

The 1st Lika Proletarian Brigade "Marko Orešković" was formed on July 8, 1942, and quickly became an active participant in the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II. Initially, the brigade was involved in operations along the Karlovac—Gospić railway, where it successfully disrupted enemy supply lines by destroying 16 kilometers of track between July 9 and 11, 1942. On July 12, the brigade attacked a train carrying Ustaše and Home Guard troops, inflicting significant losses.

Throughout the summer of 1942, the brigade engaged Italian, Ustaše, Home Guard, and Chetnik forces in various locations, including Lička Jesenica, Prokike, Križpolje, and Dabar. On August 25, 1942, the brigade achieved a notable victory by destroying a train with two locomotives and 36 wagons, capturing a large amount of military material.

In October 1942, following orders from the Croatian Main Staff, the brigade moved to Kordun and Banija, where it joined a temporary operational group of brigades to attack Glina and participate in battles for the liberation of Lađevac and Slunj, as well as the assault on Dvor na Uni.

Returning to Lika at the end of 1942 and the beginning of 1943, the brigade continued its offensive against Italian, Ustaše, Home Guard, and Chetnik positions along the Gospić—Gračac railway. During the Fourth Enemy Offensive, the brigade fought fiercely against the Italian "Sassari" Division, Chetniks, and Ustaše on the Gračac—Donji Lapac and Srb—Donji Lapac routes. By April 7, 1943, the brigade had liberated the area from Gračac to Knin.

In the summer of 1943, the brigade operated around Otočac, Gospić, and Perušić, and successfully attacked German columns on the Bihać-Donji Lapac-Gračac road in September and October. On November 11, 1943, the brigade moved to Bosnia, where it fought around Travnik and later near Majdan, Šipovo, Mlinište, and Jasenovi Potoci, primarily against German motorized units.

In February 1944, the brigade was sent to Drvar to secure the Supreme Headquarters of the NOVJ. In March and April, it engaged Chetnik forces on the Lika-Dalmatia border. During the Drvar Operation in late May and early June, the brigade operated around Drvar, Livno, and Glamoč. On July 20, 1944, as part of the 6th Proletarian Division "Nikola Tesla," it embarked on a march to Serbia, engaging in battles at Vlašić, Vranduk, Vareš, Sokolac, Prača, Kalinovik, Pivska Mountain, and Durmitor.

In Serbia, the brigade faced intense combat with Chetniks near Užička Požega and with Germans and Chetniks during the liberation of Valjevo from September 14 to 18, 1944. The brigade replenished its ranks with new recruits from Serbia. It played a significant role in the Belgrade Operation and pursued the enemy through Srem. By late 1944, the brigade returned to Belgrade for a month-long rest and replenishment.

In 1945, the brigade fought on the Srem Front, contributing to the breakthrough and liberation of Batrovci, Lipovac, Drenovci, and other villages, and continued through Slavonia, liberating Đakovo and Slavonski Brod, and crossing the Ilova and Čazma rivers. The brigade's final battles were for the liberation of Zagreb and its surroundings.

After the war, the brigade was renamed the 8th Proletarian Brigade of the Yugoslav People's Army. Throughout the war, approximately 12,000 fighters served in the brigade, with over 2,500 casualties. Twenty-eight members were awarded the Order of the People's Hero of Yugoslavia. On March 19, 1944, the brigade was declared proletarian, and on July 21, 1977, it was awarded the Order of the People's Hero on the 35th anniversary of the formation of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division "Nikola Tesla."
