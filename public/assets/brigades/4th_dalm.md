## Operations

### Initial Formation and Early Operations
The 4th Dalmatian Brigade was initially formed on January 6, 1943, in the village of Šošići on Biokovo. It was composed of the "Vid Mihaljević" Battalion and new recruits from Makarska, Brač, Hvar, and Korčula, totaling 822 fighters. Initially, it was under the command of the 4th Operational Zone of Croatia until February 12, 1943. The brigade was part of the 9th Dalmatian Division from its formation until the end of the war.

During the Battle of the Neretva, the brigade engaged in combat in the sectors of Imotski, Posušje, and Široki Brijeg. The 9th Division, including the 4th Dalmatian Brigade, was tasked with the transportation and protection of the Central Hospital during the crossing of the Neretva and Prenj. During this operation, the entire division was affected by typhus.

### Disbandment and Reformation
The brigade was disbanded on April 12, 1943, in Nevesinje, with its personnel primarily filling the ranks of the 3rd Dalmatian Brigade. It was reformed as a completely new brigade under the same name on September 12, 1943, in the Split area. Due to the majority of its fighters being from Split, it became known as the 4th Split Brigade.

### Subsequent Operations
As part of its 9th Division, the brigade participated in the defense of Split against German forces. It distinguished itself during the German advance in November and December, particularly during Operation "Citen." The brigade was actively engaged in fierce battles during the Drvar Operation and participated in the liberation of Livno, Duvno, and Posušje. It played a significant role in the Knin and Mostar operations.

### Final Operations and Achievements
In the Trieste Operation, the brigade advanced through Istria, liberating towns such as Plomin, Labin, and Raša, and participated in street battles for Trieste. The 4th Dalmatian Brigade was honored with the Order of Merit for the People with a Golden Star and the Order of Brotherhood and Unity with a Golden Wreath for its contributions during the war.
