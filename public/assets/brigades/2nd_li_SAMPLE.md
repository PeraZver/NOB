## Operations

### Formation and Early Battles (1942)
The 2nd Lika Proletarian Assault Brigade was formed on August 19, 1942, in Krbavsko polje, a strategic plateau in the Lika region of Croatia. The brigade was created from various partisan detachments that had been operating in the area, consolidating them into a more effective fighting force.

Immediately after its formation, the brigade engaged in defensive operations against German and Italian forces attempting to establish control over the Lika region. The unit proved its combat effectiveness in several skirmishes throughout the autumn of 1942.

### Operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1943)
During 1943, the brigade participated in major operations across Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was involved in the battles for the liberation of several towns and played a supporting role in larger partisan offensive operations. The unit demonstrated particular effectiveness in mountain warfare and hit-and-run tactics against Axis supply lines.

### Battle on Sutjeska (June 1943)
One of the brigade's most significant engagements was its participation in the Battle of Sutjeska in June 1943. This brutal battle saw the brigade fighting alongside other partisan units to break through a massive German encirclement. Despite heavy losses, the brigade helped ensure the survival of the partisan Main Operational Group.

### Continued Operations (1943-1945)
After Sutjeska, the brigade was reorganized and continued operations throughout Croatia and Bosnia. It participated in the liberation campaigns of 1944 and 1945, fighting in numerous battles to expel Axis forces from Yugoslav territory.

### Final Phase and Liberation (1945)
In the final months of the war, the 2nd Lika Proletarian Assault Brigade took part in the operations to liberate northern Croatia and Slovenia. The unit fought until the German surrender in May 1945, having established itself as one of the respected brigades of the People's Liberation Army.

Throughout its service, the brigade maintained high morale despite significant casualties and demonstrated the effectiveness of partisan warfare tactics. After the war, it was recognized for its contributions to the liberation of Yugoslavia.
