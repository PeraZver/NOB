A group of political prisoners (mostly Croatian communists and other anti-fascists) were to be executed in retaliation for Partisan attacks. On 9 July 1941, the first group of ten, including Božidar Adžija, Otokar Keršovani, Ognjen Prica, Zvonimir Richtmann and Viktor Rosenzweig, was executed. The KPH and local Partisans responded by organising a mass-escape on 13 July 1941, the escape failed for all but 14 of the prisoners; 31 were shot whilst escaping, while 44 were recaptured and summarily executed at Dotrščina by 17 July, including August Cesarec.
