The 12th Slavonian Division of the NOVJ was established on December 30, 1942 under the initial designation “4th Division of the Main Staff of the NOV and PO of Croatia.” It received its final name, the 12th Division of the NOVJ, on May 9, 1943. From May 17, 1943, the division was incorporated into the 6th Slavonian Corps.

## Operations
Operating in the complex and heavily militarized terrain of Slavonia, the 12th Slavonian Division quickly distinguished itself through a broad spectrum of military actions carried out in an area that was both highly sensitive and strongly fortified by Axis forces. Its operations ranged from sabotage and ambushes on communication lines and enemy patrols, to swift raids against smaller garrisons, as well as participation in coordinated corps-level offensives that required advanced planning, maneuvering, and endurance.

A restructuring occurred on November 3, 1943, when the 12th and 16th brigades were reassigned from the division. In their place, two new brigades entered its composition: the 25th Brod Brigade and the Czechoslovak Brigade “Jan Žiška”. 

During the intense and often brutal fighting between May 1944 and March 1945, the division sustained heavy losses among its leadership. Two division commanders were killed in action: Nikola Demonja fell in Slavonska Požega, while Milan Stanivuković was killed in Levanjska Varoš. Another commander, Dušan Pekić, was wounded in Virovitica on October 5.

The same period brought significant casualties among brigade leaders as well. From June 1944 to March 1945, the division lost eight brigade commanders: Nikola Miljanović Karaula, Ivan Senjug, Milivoje Babac, Milan Bobić, Ivo Marinković, Josip Ružička, Anton Doležal, and Uroš Popara. In addition to these losses, four brigade political commissars and one deputy brigade commander were also killed. This succession of casualties reflects not only the ferocity of the fighting in Slavonia but also the persistent front-line presence and tactical responsibilities borne by partisan officers.

On October 10, 1944, in recognition of its sustained combat achievements, high mobility, and resilience in some of the most demanding operational conditions, the 12th Slavonian Division was officially designated a Strike Division. This title represented a significant honor, acknowledging the division’s exceptional contribution to the liberation struggle and its exemplary battlefield performance across a wide span of operations.
