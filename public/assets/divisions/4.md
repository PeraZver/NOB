## Operations

The 4th Krajina Division, part of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, was formed on November 9, 1942, at Glamoč Field by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. Initially composed of the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Krajina Brigades, the division was soon reinforced by the Eighth Krajina Brigade in December 1942. However, in April 1943, the Second and Fifth Brigades were detached, and the Eleventh Krajina Brigade joined in September 1943. Briefly, the Tenth and Twelfth Krajina Brigades also came under its command.

From its inception until May 1943, the division was part of the First Bosnian Corps, later renamed the Third Bosnian Corps. It was then transferred to the Second Bosnian Corps, which became the Fifth Bosnian Corps. By April 1945, the division was integrated into the Second Army of the Yugoslav Army, recognized as one of the elite units of the National Liberation Army.

### Early Operations (1942-1943)
The division's initial operations in late November and December 1942 involved offensive actions against German and Ustaše forces in the Sana and Una valleys. During Operation "Weiss I," the division successfully halted and encircled the German 737th Regiment of the 717th Division, although the intervention of the 7th SS Division and the 369th Legionary Division prevented its destruction.

### Mid-War Operations (1943-1944)
Throughout the war, the division primarily operated in western and central Bosnia, with a notable campaign in central Dalmatia in September 1943. Successful offensives included attacks on Bosanska Dubica and Sanski Most in October 1943. The division also participated in the First and Second Banja Luka Operations and engaged in six months of combat for Travnik, during which its first commander, Josip Mažar Šoša, was killed.

### Final Operations (1945)
In the final stages of the war, the division took part in the Sarajevo Operation and the liberation of Karlovac. On May 12, 1945, alongside the Third and Tenth Divisions, it captured the German 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen" and the 373rd Legionary Division near Zidani Most. In May 1945, an Artillery Brigade was formed within the division, further enhancing its capabilities.
