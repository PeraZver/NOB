## Operations

The 10th Krajina Division was formed on February 13, 1943, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ). Initially, the division was composed of the 9th Krajina Assault Brigade and several smaller detachments, totaling around 700 fighters. Due to the ongoing "Weiss II" operation, the division's full formation took several weeks.

In March and April 1943, the 10th Krajina Assault Brigade was part of the division. On August 10, 1943, the 7th Krajina Assault Brigade permanently joined the division. The 13th Krajina Assault Brigade was part of the division from September 1943 until March 26, 1944, and the 17th Krajina Assault Brigade joined in May 1944 and remained until the end of the war.

By October 1943, the division's strength had increased to 3,509 fighters. It continued to grow, reaching 5,859 fighters by October 1944 and 7,973 by May 1945. Initially, the division was part of the 1st Bosnian Corps, but from May 14, 1943, it became part of the 2nd Bosnian Corps, which was later renamed the 5th Corps of the NOVJ in October.

The 10th Krajina Division participated in all offensive and defensive operations of the 5th Bosnian Corps. In January 1944, it took part in the First Banja Luka Operation. In October 1944, the division was involved in the attack on Travnik. In 1945, it participated in the Sarajevo and Karlovac operations.

The division was commanded by Milorad Mijatović from its formation, with Vojo Todorović Lerer taking over until the end of the war. The political commissar was Nikola Kotle from the formation of the division, with Vlado Dapčević assuming the role from mid-1944 until the war's end.
