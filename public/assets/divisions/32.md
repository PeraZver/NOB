# 32. Zagorje Division

## Formation
The 32nd Zagorje Division was formed on 12 December 1943 on Kalnik Mountain from the *Braća Radić* and *Matija Gubec* brigades, totaling about 1,760 fighters. It was initially under the 2nd Operational Zone HQ, later subordinated to the 10th Zagreb Corps.

## Early Fighting and Loss of Kalnik Free Territory (Jan–Feb 1944)
In January 1944, the division operated in Hrvatsko Zagorje, clashing with Ustasha units from Zagreb’s garrison, including Pavelić’s elite *Tjelesni zdrug* (Physical Company).  
During the Ustasha operation “Dubrovnik,” the division was pushed from Kalnik as enemy forces captured Koprivnica, Ludbreg, Ivanec, and parts of Podravina.

## Return to Zagorje and Expansion Toward Zagreb (Spring 1944)
In March–April 1944, the division—now operating near the outskirts of Zagreb, the center of Ustasha power—focused on destroying strongpoints and recruiting new fighters.

Key engagements close to the Zagreb area included:
- clashes around Zlatar, Tuheljske Toplice, Klanjec, Budinščina, Podrut, and Zajezda
- constant fighting with Ustasha and Home Guard forces sent from Zagreb to secure approaches to the capital

The division’s success allowed the formation of the 1st Zagorje Brigade in May.

In mid-May, the 1st Ustasha Regiment (from Zagreb’s security zone: Novi Marof – Zlatar – Zelina – Ivanec) launched a major offensive, after which the division temporarily withdrew toward Moslavina and Bilogora.

## Sustained Operations Against Zagreb’s Defensive Belt (Summer–Autumn 1944)
Following 10th Corps directives to disrupt enemy communications, the division concentrated on railroads and garrisons critical to Zagreb’s supply and security:

- destruction of the Zagreb–Varaždin railway (12.5 km destroyed between 2–4 September)
- night attack on Sveti Ivan Zelina (7/8 September) – key Ustasha defensive node northeast of Zagreb
- participation in the attack on Križevci (13–14 September)
- raids on Trgovišće and Hrašćina (3 November)
- fierce fighting near Donja Zelina (7/8 November)
- ongoing destruction of Zagreb–Dugo Selo and Zagreb–Križevci railways

By late 1944, the division had grown to over 3,400 fighters.

## Final Phase and End of War (Late 1944–May 1945)
In late 1944 and early 1945, the division fought in the Virovitica bridgehead and later repelled German Cossack units in Moslavina.  
In April–May 1945, it participated in the liberation of Podravina, Kalnik, Bilogora, and Hrvatsko Zagorje contributing to the encirclement and collapse of Ustasha-dominated forces retreating from Zagreb.

By the end of April 1945, the division fielded four brigades with nearly 3,530 fighters.
