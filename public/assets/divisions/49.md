## Operations

### Initial Formation and Reorganization
The 49th Macedonian Division was formed on September 10, 1944, in the village of Crnovec near Bitola. Initially, it comprised the Fifth and Seventh Macedonian Brigades and the Bitola-Prespa Partisan Detachment. In early October 1944, the division underwent reorganization, incorporating the Second Macedonian Brigade and the Kostur-Lerin Battalion "Goče." Subsequently, it became part of the Fifteenth Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

### Combat Engagements
Following the liberation of Prilep on September 2, 1944, the Second Brigade was replaced by the Ninth Macedonian Brigade within the division. The division's composition then included the Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Macedonian Brigades, along with the First Aegean Brigade. The division engaged in battles along the Lerin-Bitola and Ohrid-Resen-Bitola-Prilep communication lines, confronting the German Army Group E retreating from Greece.

### Further Reinforcements
In December 1944, the division was further reinforced with the inclusion of the Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Macedonian Brigades, as well as the First Macedonian Artillery Brigade. These additions bolstered the division's capabilities as it continued its operations against Axis forces in the region.
