## Operations

The 13th Littoral-Gorski Kotar Division was formed in April 1943 in Brinje, under the directive of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ). Initially comprising the Sixth and Fourteenth Littoral-Gorski Kotar Brigades, the division operated primarily in the regions of Gorski Kotar and the Croatian Littoral. On May 17, 1943, the Sixth Brigade was renamed the First Brigade, and the Fourteenth became the Second Brigade.

### Early Operations (April - September 1943)
From its inception until June 25, 1943, the division, alongside the Second Brigade, collaborated with units from the Second Operational Zone of Croatia around Bosiljevo. From May 12, it engaged in fierce battles against Italian and quisling forces to defend the Brinje–Žuta Lokva–Vratnik–Senj route. The division also defended the free territory of Gorski Kotar and the Croatian Littoral with the help of the First and Second Littoral-Gorski Kotar Partisan Detachments. By late June 1943, the division took over the defense of the Brinje–Vratnik–Senj route, with battles continuing until September 8, 1943.

### Italian Capitulation and Reorganization (September 1943)
During the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the division fought against the Italian "Murđe" Division and, with local support, disarmed much of the Italian Fifth Corps in the Croatian Littoral and Gorski Kotar. This resulted in the acquisition of a significant amount of heavy and light weaponry. Approximately 10,000 new fighters joined the Partisans, leading to the formation of new brigades within the division. By September 20, 1943, the division had been reorganized, with the Fifth and Sixth Brigades disbanded, and their personnel redistributed among the first four brigades. The division then had about 5,100 fighters, with one battalion and 70 leaders sent to Istria to support the local liberation movement.

### Continued Engagements and Expansion (Late 1943 - 1944)
On September 25, 1943, elements of the division, in coordination with NOVJ naval units, conducted an assault on Lošinj, liberating it after two days of fighting. In October, the division participated in battles in the Perušić, Gospić, and Karlobag areas against various enemy forces, liberating Karlobag on October 3. During the German October Offensive, the division faced significant losses but managed to reclaim lost territory by late October.

In November 1943, the 18th Division of the Seventh Slovenian Corps was transferred to the division's operational area. Together, they engaged in battles in December against encircled Ustaša-Domobran forces in Vrbovsko. By January 1944, the division had eliminated several enemy strongholds along the Karlobag–Gospić line. The division was incorporated into the Eleventh Corps of NOVJ by the end of January 1944.

### Final Operations and Liberation Efforts (1944 - 1945)
Throughout 1944, the division engaged in numerous battles against German and Ustaša forces in various regions, including Hreljin, Brinje, and Otočac. It liberated Gomirje in March and participated in operations around Drežnica and Bosiljevo. The division's strength was approximately 4,647 fighters by mid-1944.

In August, it fought around Bosiljevo, Bosanaca, Drežnica, and Josipdol. By September, the division was engaged in operations along the Ogulin–Brinje–Senj–Kraljevica route and in the Sušak area. In November, the division moved to Lika, capturing Sveti Rok and clearing the Lovinac–Obrovac route. It participated in the liberation of Gračac in December and was designated as an "assault" division on December 20, 1944.

In April 1945, the division was reinforced with fighters from the disbanded 35th Division. It took part in the final operations for the liberation of Lika, the Croatian Littoral, Gorski Kotar, and parts of Slovenia. The division fought its last battles against encircled German forces on May 7, 1945, and by the end of the war, it had approximately 5,600 fighters.
