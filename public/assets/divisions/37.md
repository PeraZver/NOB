## Operations

The 37th Sandžak Division was formed on March 4, 1944, and became part of the Second Proletarian Corps. Initially composed of the Third Proletarian Sandžak, Fourth Sandžak, and Eighth Montenegrin Brigades, the division started with around 2,300 fighters. By December 1944, it had grown to about 9,000 fighters, and by May 1, 1945, it reached a strength of 11,188. The division was reinforced by the Fifth Sandžak Brigade on August 21, and in April 1945, an Artillery Brigade was formed within the division.

### 1944 Operations

The division operated in Sandžak and the Berane region, engaging German forces, Chetniks, and Muslim quisling militias. It defended the free territories of Sandžak and Montenegro, facilitating the advance of the Second Proletarian and Fifth Krajina Divisions into Serbia in March 1944. In mid-April, facing superior enemy forces, the division was forced to withdraw from Sandžak to the left bank of the Tara River. In coordination with the Third Division, it prevented German and quisling forces from penetrating the free territory of Montenegro. From April 19 to the end of the month, the division launched counterattacks, reaching the Lim River and regaining the free territory of Sandžak.

During May and June, the division operated between the Tara and Lim rivers. In July, it crossed the Lim River twice, capturing Nova Varoš, Priboj, and Rudo. By August 10, it advanced into the wider Zlatibor region, defeating and partially destroying the Chetnik Mileševski, Zlatiborski, and Fourth Assault Corps. To support the First Proletarian Corps, the division returned to the left bank of the Lim River on August 14/15 and crossed the Lim River for the third time at Rudo and Priboj on August 21/22.

Under the direct command of the Supreme Headquarters, the division engaged in fierce battles against elements of the German 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen," the Second Regiment "Brandenburg," and the "Krempler" Legion in late August and early September. It supported the First Proletarian and later the Twelfth Corps in their advance into Serbia. The division liberated Nova Varoš on September 5/6 and continued operations in Sandžak, western Serbia, and the Drina Valley until the end of October. During this period, it liberated Priboj on September 1, Prijepolje on September 29, Pljevlja on October 1, Višegrad on October 9, Goražde on October 11, and Užice in mid-October, in cooperation with the Užice Partisan Detachment.

### 1944-1945 Winter Operations

From November 1944 to January 1945, the division participated in final operations to liberate Sandžak from the German 21st and 91st Army Corps, which were retreating to Bosnia. In a series of intense battles, particularly at Savin's Bend and along the Sjenica—Prijepolje—Nova Varoš axis, the division inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, captured large quantities of war material, and finally liberated Pljevlja on November 18/19, Prijepolje on January 10, 1945, and Priboj on January 12, 1945.

### 1945 Operations in Bosnia

In operations in Bosnia against the German 181st and 297th Infantry Divisions, the division liberated Rudo on January 15, Višegrad on February 15, Goražde on March 5, Pale on March 28/29, and Rogatica on March 30. It played a significant role in the liberation of Sarajevo in early April while part of the Third Corps. In late April and May 1945, the division participated in the destruction of Chetnik forces in the Kalinovik, Zelengora, Sutjeska, Rogatica regions, and the Drina Valley.
