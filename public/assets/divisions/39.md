## Operations

The 39th Krajina Division was formed on March 26, 1944, in Western Bosnia, as part of the Yugoslav Partisan movement. Initially, it comprised the 13th and 15th Krajina Brigades, with the 16th Krajina Brigade joining from May to November 1944, and the 20th Krajina Kozara Shock Brigade joining from October 1944 until the end of the war. The division was part of the 5th Corps and operated primarily in the Bosnian Krajina region, engaging in significant battles and operations throughout its existence.

### Early Operations and Drvar Operation (1944)
In the days following its formation, the division engaged in combat with elements of the German 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen," which frequently raided free territories around Mrkonjić Grad from Jajce. The division also participated in an unsuccessful attack on Prijedor on April 19-20, 1944, alongside the 4th and 10th Divisions. Concurrently, it was forced to deploy significant forces against Chetnik units around Manjača, Mrkonjić Grad, and the source of the Sana River.

During the Drvar Operation in late May 1944, the division, in cooperation with the 1st Proletarian Division, engaged in fierce defensive battles against the advancing 7th SS Division. The division then launched counterattacks on enemy communications and garrisons, notably attacking Ribnik on June 2, liberating Ključ on June 3, and engaging in a sharp battle near Mrkonjić Grad on June 5. On June 14, it attacked a Home Guard battalion between Ključ and Bosanski Petrovac, inflicting significant losses.

### Continued Engagements and Banja Luka Operations (1944)
Throughout July and August, the division conducted several attacks on German and collaborationist columns and garrisons in Kozarac, Bosanski Petrovac, and Mrkonjić Grad. In battles near Oštrelj on August 17, 19, and 24, it incapacitated 127 German soldiers. The division liberated Drvar on August 31, Jajce and Gornji Vakuf on September 9, and Donji Vakuf on September 10, before shifting operations towards Banja Luka.

The division participated in the Second Banja Luka Operation from September 18 to 28, capturing parts of the city, including Gornji Šeher and Lauš, and engaging in heavy fighting around Kastel and the railway station. It also captured the Zalužani airfield near Banja Luka but faced German reinforcements that relieved the besieged garrison in Kastel.

### Late 1944 and Final Operations (1945)
Following the departure of the 4th Division towards Travnik and the Bosna River valley, the 39th Division assumed control of operations in the Sana, Una, and Kozara regions. In November, it successfully repelled 2,500 Ustaše from Bosanska Dubica and defeated 1,200 Chetniks near Banja Luka on November 24, inflicting around 110 casualties. The division continued to engage German and Chetnik forces around Banja Luka and Bosanski Novi in December. An artillery battalion was formed within the division on December 1, and by December 15, its strength had increased to 6,485 fighters.

In early 1945, the division conducted minor operations in the Una valley, repelling several enemy incursions. During the Sarajevo Operation in April 1945, its 13th Brigade participated in battles against German forces as part of the Zenica Sector Brigade Group. In the final operations of the Second Army of the Yugoslav Army, the division fought for the liberation of Bosanski Novi, Dvor, and Zagreb, and subsequently disarmed defeated occupying and collaborationist units along the Zagreb—Brežice—Celje axis.
