## Operations

### Initial Operations and Expansion
The 53rd Central Bosnian Division was formed as part of the 5th Bosnian Corps in July 1944. Initially, the division had 3,120 fighters, equipped with rifles, machine guns, mortars, and artillery. By August 1944, the division's strength had grown to nearly 6,000 fighters. The division's operational area covered the northern part of central Bosnia, bounded by the rivers Bosna, Sava, Vrbas, Vrbanja, and the Vlašić mountain.

In August 1944, the division contributed a battalion to form the 1st Brigade of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Division of KNOJ. It successfully cleared the central part of its operational area, defeating elements of the Central Bosnian Corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVuO) and repelling several minor enemy incursions.

### Operation Ratvik and Subsequent Engagements
From September 1 to 7, 1944, the division participated in Operation Ratvik, coordinated with Allied air forces, to disrupt German communications in Yugoslavia. Reinforced by the 21st Slavonian Brigade of the 28th Slavonian Division, the division halted traffic on the railway and road from Slavonski Brod to Sarajevo, destroying bridges and viaducts. It liberated several towns, including Teslić, Jelah, Tešanj, and Derventa, and penetrated Maglaj and Doboj, where it destroyed the 1st Domobran Hunter Regiment. The 6th Domobran Regiment defected to the Partisans, significantly increasing the division's strength.

### Banja Luka Operations
From September 18 to 28, 1944, the division participated in the Second Banja Luka Operation, capturing key locations such as the Trapiste Monastery and Vrbanja village, and entering the center of Banja Luka. However, weakened defenses allowed enemy forces to counterattack, leading to setbacks near Klupe and Klašnice.

After withdrawing from Banja Luka, the division regrouped and defeated parts of the 1st Central Bosnian and Bosnian-Krajina Corps of JVuO. It unsuccessfully attacked Kotor Varoš on October 14 but successfully disrupted the Slavonski Brod-Doboj railway on October 22, securing the area between Derventa and Doboj.

### Winter Operations and Final Campaigns
From November 1944 to February 1945, the division secured free territory, disrupting German Army Group E's retreat from Sarajevo to Slavonski Brod. It destroyed armored trains and hundreds of vehicles, while maintaining security against enemy garrisons and outposts.

In March 1945, the division broke a strong JVuO group at Vučjak and assisted the 2nd Yugoslav Army in liberating towns in the Bosna valley. Its 18th Brigade joined the Zenica Brigade Group, contributing to the liberation of Zenica in April. The division then liberated Žepče and Kotor Varoš and, from April 25, was part of the 3rd Bosnian Corps, tasked with eliminating remaining Chetnik and Ustaše forces in the Odžak region.

The division's operations were marked by strategic disruptions of enemy communications, successful liberation of key towns, and significant contributions to the final defeat of Axis-aligned forces in the region.
