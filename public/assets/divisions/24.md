## Operations

The 24th Serbian Division, initially named the Fourth Serbian Division, was formed on June 10, 1944, in the Jablanica region of Pusta Reka. It was initially composed of the Eleventh and Seventeenth Serbian Brigades, with the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Brigades joining shortly thereafter. By February 28, 1945, the division's strength had grown to 9,185 fighters.

In June 1944, the division engaged in significant battles against the Bulgarian 27th Division on Mount Radan, near Petrovac and Rasovica, successfully defeating a Bulgarian regiment. Later that month and into early July, it fought against elements of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVuO) South Morava and Rasina-Toplica Corps groups.

During the Toplica-Jablanica Operation in July, the division, alongside the 21st Serbian Division, bore the brunt of combat against the Fourth Assault Corps of the JVuO, parts of the Serbian State Guard, and elements of the Bulgarian 27th Division. It notably defeated and captured most of the Bulgarian 123rd Regiment in the village of Prekopčelica.

Following this operation, the division operated in the Lebane area, along the Leskovac–Vranje and Leskovac–Lebane routes, engaging German Army Group E units until early September. It fought particularly intense battles in the Grdelica Gorge, near Doljevac, and Leskovac, attacking the city on August 30 and September 19-20, but withdrawing both times.

During the Niš Operation, the division operated west of Niš. On October 12, it engaged in heavy fighting alongside the 47th Serbian Division against the main force of the 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen" on the Doljevac–Mramor line, with support from Bulgarian artillery and tank brigades. On October 14, in cooperation with the same units and with air support from the Red Army, the division decisively defeated the main force of the German 7th SS Division in the Mramor–Jug-Bogdanovac area, capturing large quantities of war material.

In the Kosovo Operation, the division operated on the right flank and distinguished itself in battles along the Ugljarski Krš–Krtinjak–Tačevac line, capturing Bajgora between October 23 and 28. From December 3, 1944, the division was placed under the command of the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Serbia, tasked with clearing Kosovo of Ballist and other Albanian enemy forces.

In March 1945, the division became a reserve unit of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army.
