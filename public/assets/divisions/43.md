## Operations

The 43rd Istrian Division was an active unit of the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II. Formed on August 29, 1944, in Čabar, Gorski kotar, the division initially consisted of three brigades: the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Istrian Brigades. At its inception, the division had a strength of 3,392 fighters, including an Italian battalion named "Pino Budicin" within the First Brigade. By November 1944, an artillery division was also incorporated into the division's structure.

The division's operational areas extended beyond Istria to include Gorski kotar, the Croatian Littoral, and the Pokuplje region up to Karlovac. In March 1945, its operations expanded to the Žumberak area. Initially part of the 11th Corps of the NOVJ, the division was integrated into the 4th Army of the Yugoslav Army on March 2, 1945.

During the final operations for liberation, the 43rd Istrian Division engaged in behind-the-lines activities, targeting enemy strongholds and communication lines. Following the dissolution of the Eleventh Corps, the division came under the direct command of the Fourth Army. After April 24, 1945, the division's units began entering Istria. The First Brigade captured enemy positions in Mrakovščina and Materija during the night of April 29-30 and encircled Pazin by May 5. Meanwhile, the Second Brigade was positioned west of the Postojna–Rakek line on April 28, and by May 5, it was engaged in minor skirmishes alongside the Third Brigade on the Topolovec–Pomjan line. The Third Brigade crossed the battlefield on the Mlaka–Rijeka line during the night of April 19-20 and subsequently the Trieste–Rijeka railway line. It supported the Ninth Division's units while also operating in the Buzet–Buje–Koper area.
