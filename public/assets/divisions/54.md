## Operations

### Initial Engagements and the Battle of Batina
Immediately after its formation, the 51st Vojvodina Division was integrated with units of the Red Army to participate in the operation to force the Danube River in the region of Batina and near Apatin. From November 11 to November 23, 1944, the division engaged in fierce battles for the bridgeheads at Batina and Apatin. Despite the challenging terrain and exposure to German artillery and machine-gun fire, the division successfully collaborated with the Red Army units, significantly contributing to the defeat of German forces at the bridgeheads. During these battles, the division suffered losses of 271 killed and 850 wounded.

### Liberation of Baranja and Recognition
Following the battles at Batina, the division participated in the liberation of Baranja and reached the Yugoslav-Hungarian border. For their bravery and persistence in the liberation of Baranja, the fighters and leaders of the division were commended by the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia on December 1, 1944. The victory in this operation was marked by the Red Army command with a salvo of 20 artillery volleys from 224 guns, and the division was awarded the honorary title "Danube."

### Operations in 1945
From January 1, 1945, the division became part of the newly formed Third Army of the Yugoslav Army. On January 18/19, its units crossed to the right bank of the Drava River at the Virovitica bridgehead, held by the Sixth and Tenth Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia, and took positions near Podravska Slatina. There, in cooperation with the Sixteenth Vojvodina Division, they engaged in heavy fighting against German and Ustaša-Domobran forces.

Under pressure from strong German forces during Operation Vukodlak, the Vojvodina divisions, including the 51st, withdrew to the northern bank of the Drava on February 8/9, 1945, and were deployed to defend the front on the Drava.

In March 1945, during the German Operation Frilingservahen, the division participated in the elimination of the German bridgehead at Bolman.

### Final Operations and the Liberation of Yugoslavia
In the final operations of the Yugoslav Army for the complete liberation of Yugoslavia, the division distinguished itself in battles for the liberation of Osijek on April 14; Đurđevac on May 2; Koprivnica on May 5; Ptuj on May 9; and notably in the encirclement and destruction of the German-Chetnik group near Dravograd from May 12 to May 15, which was attempting to break through towards Klagenfurt.
