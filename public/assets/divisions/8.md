## Operations

The 8th Kordun Division, recognized as one of the elite units of the Yugoslav Partisans, was formed on November 22, 1942, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ). Initially comprising the Fourth and Fifth Kordun Brigades and the Sixth Primorsko-Goranska Brigade, the latter was soon replaced by the Fifteenth Kordun Brigade due to operational constraints.

### Early Operations and Defensive Actions
At the onset of Operation "Weiss I" in early 1943, the division was incomplete, with the Fourth Kordun Brigade engaged in operations at Žumberak alongside the Thirteenth Proletarian Brigade. The division faced an offensive by the 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen" advancing from the Karlovac-Petrinja line towards Slunj and Velika Kladuša, forcing the division into defensive maneuvers and a strategic withdrawal towards Lika.

### Offensive Engagements in 1943
Throughout the winter and spring of 1943, the 8th Kordun Division, in coordination with the Sixth Lika Division, conducted successful offensive operations, including attacks on Otočac in April and Gospić in May. The division was actively involved in numerous defensive and offensive actions against German, Italian, Ustaše-Domobran, and Chetnik forces in the region between the Kupa and Una rivers.

In November 1943, the division participated in the attack on Glina and faced the onslaught of the 15th and 69th German Corps during Operation "Panther" in December.

### Continued Resistance and Recognition in 1944
In March 1944, the division successfully repelled an Axis offensive in the Plašćanska Valley. It took part in the attack on Cazin in April and engaged in maneuver-based defensive battles during Operation "Chess" in May. By June and July 1944, the division, in conjunction with the 34th Croatian Division and Slovenian units, targeted Axis-Quisling garrisons and communication lines in Pokuplje, Turopolje, Žumberak, and Bela Krajina in Slovenia. In August and September, the division resumed operations in the Kordun, Lika, and Banija regions.

### Final Operations and Liberation Efforts
In late October 1944, the division moved to the Cazin Krajina, engaging in intense combat operations during the November attack on Cazin. The winter of 1944/45 saw the division in fierce battles with the German 15th Corps over critical communication and defensive points in Lika and Kordun. Following the disbandment of the Una Operational Group, the division incorporated its Muslim Brigade and the Krajina Partisan Detachment.

During the final operations for the liberation of Yugoslavia, the 8th Kordun Division was subordinated to the Fourth Army of the Yugoslav Army, participating in the liberation of Bihać, the Lika-Primorje, and Trieste operations.

On June 16, 1944, the division was designated as "strike" (udarna) by the Supreme Headquarters of NOV and POJ in recognition of its outstanding achievements.
