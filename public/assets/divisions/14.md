## Operations

The 14th Slovenian Division was formed on July 13, 1943, in Dolenjska, initially comprising the First and Second Slovenian Assault Brigades. By August 9, 1943, the division expanded to include the Third and Seventh Slovenian Assault Brigades, bringing its strength to around 2,400 fighters.

### Initial Engagements and Italian Surrender

On July 24, 1943, the division, in cooperation with the 15th Slovenian Division, launched an attack on the Italian stronghold at Žužemberk. This assault escalated into prolonged street fighting and subsequent heavy battles against a numerically superior Italian force. Following Italy's capitulation, the division was reinforced, and three additional brigades were formed, although two were later disbanded. By late September 1943, the division consisted of the First, Second, and the newly added Thirteenth Slovenian Brigade "Mirko Bračič."

### Integration into the Seventh Slovenian Corps

In early October 1943, the division became part of the Seventh Slovenian Corps. During this period, on October 13-14, 1943, it successfully executed a significant sabotage operation on the Štampetov Bridge, disrupting the railway connection between the Ljubljana Basin and the Gulf of Trieste.

### German Offensive and Subsequent Operations

The division was caught in the German "Rommel" offensive from October 21 to November 10, 1944. After the German offensive concluded, the Seventh Corps initiated its own offensive. As part of this operation, the 14th Division captured Grahovo on November 22, followed by Cerknica and Begunje, and on December 1, Velike Lašče. However, a December 9 attack on the German-White Guard garrison in Kočevje had to be halted due to the breakthrough of the German 162nd Division.

### Operations in Styria and Final Campaigns

Due to heavy losses in the autumn of 1943, the division's numbers dwindled significantly. On January 6, 1944, it was deployed to Styria to disrupt communications and bolster the National Liberation Movement in this strategically vital region, with only 1,127 fighters remaining. During the march and breakthrough across Žumberak, Pokulja, and Croatian Zagorje to Styria, its numbers were nearly halved. After recuperating and reinforcing in the Savinja Alps, the division conducted intensive attacks on communications and smaller German garrisons.

Throughout the latter half of 1944 and early 1945, despite increasing German forces in the area, the 14th Slovenian Division maintained intense and successful operations, establishing several free territories. In recognition of its achievements and sacrifices, the division was designated as an "Assault Division" on October 26, 1944.

In the final operations, the 14th Slovenian Division played a crucial role in dismantling and disarming large German and collaborationist forces in Slovenian and Austrian Carinthia.
