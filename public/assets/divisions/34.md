# 34th Croatian Division

## Formation  
The 34th Croatian Assault Division was established on 30 January 1944 in the area of Žumberak, Pokuplje, and Turopolje, by order of the Headquarters of NOV and PO for Croatia. 
It was formed from:  
- 16th Youth Brigade “Joža Vlahović”  
- Brigade “Franjo Ogulinac Seljo”  
- the Žumberak NOP Detachment  
- the Turopolje-Posavina NOP Detachment 

Upon formation the division numbered 3,363 fighters and officers, armed with: 2,378 rifles; 77 submachine guns; 105 light machine guns; 49 heavy machine guns; 22 mortars; 3 anti-tank guns; and 1 field gun. The division commander was **Martin Dasović**, and commisar was **Franjo Knebil** .

The division was subordinated to the 4th Corps NOVJ and initially operated in Žumberak, Pokuplje, Turopolje, as well as northern parts of Kordun and Banija. 

## Operations 

### Early Engagements (Winter–Spring 1944)  
Immediately after formation, the division defended the free territory of Žumberak and Pokuplje. It launched aggressive operations against German 1st Cossack Cavalry Division, Ustaša, and Home Guard forces.

Notable engagements and operations:  
- 3 February: attack on the enemy stronghold in Odra. 
- Early March: combats in Brezovica, Goli Breg, Horvati; 19–20 March near Draganić and Gornja Kupčina; 23 March near Sveta Margareta; 28 March operations around Hrženik, Strmec, Donji Pribić and Gornja Kupčina. 
- April: diversification of operations — railway sabotages (e.g. Turopolje–Lekenik), destruction of the Zagreb–Sisak rail line, repelling enemy attacks in several locales (e.g. Plešivica, Hruševac, Pribić, Hutina). 

By 1 May 1944, the 16th Youth Brigade “Joža Vlahović” left the division; in turn, a Karlovac Brigade was integrated. 

### Mid-1944: Retreat, Reorganization, and Guerrilla Warfare  
Between 26–28 April 1944, heavy clashes with Ustaša-domobranski and German forces in Žumberak forced a brief withdrawal into Slovenia. After returning, in May the division attacked several villages (e.g. Gornje/Donje Izimje, Stančaki) and captured Ponikve on 31 May.

In June:  
- Destroyed the railway Zagreb–Karlovac.  
- Between 27 June and 2 July, repelled multiple enemy offensives on free territory in Žumberak, including defense of communication lines and securing supplies from Posavina. 

In July–August, the division expanded by adding the Karlovac Partisan Detachment, the newly formed Žumberak Brigade, and later (mid-September) the Samobor-Jaska Partisan Detachment. 

### Late 1944: Expanded Sabotage, Partisan Actions, and Increased Strength  
From September onward, the division intensified sabotage operations — especially targeting railway lines — while its units operated along routes Zagreb–Karlovac, Karlovac–Metlika, and Zagreb–Sisak. 

By end of 1944, the division participated in liberation of localities (e.g. Peščanica, Lekenik, Babica, Draganić, Domagović, Lazina), capturing enemy soldiers and seizing weapons and ammunition. 

On 31 December 1944, the division was declared an “assault division” (udarna), reflecting its increased size, role and combat record.

By April 1945, its strength had grown to approximately 6,544 fighters and officers. 

### Final Phase and Liberation Operations (1945)  
From early 1945 until war’s end, the 34th Division remained active on its core territory, participating in final offensives to liberate Pokuplje and Žumberak. Among its actions:  
- Liberation of Luka and Rečica (15–16 January) and Zažina (28 January) 1945. 
- February: repelling enemy attacks, capturing and destroying enemy infrastructure (including railways) on many occasions. 
- March: attacks on enemy columns, defense of free territories around Petrinja and Glina. 
- April–May 1945: fought in Kordun and took part in the final liberation of Karlovac.

At the end of the war the division comprised of the Žumberak Brigade, the Karlovac Brigade, and the “Franjo Ogulinac Seljo” Brigade, maintaining a strength of ~6,544 fighters and officers.
