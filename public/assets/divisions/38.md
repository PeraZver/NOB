## Operations

The 38th East Bosnian Division, part of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, was formed on March 6, 1944, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. Initially, the division operated in the Majevica mountain region and Posavina. By mid-April 1944, it engaged in defensive battles against the German 13th SS Division "Handschar" alongside the 16th and 36th Divisions of the NOVJ. During these battles, the 17th Brigade was pushed towards Birač but managed to save some wounded from the corps hospital in Donja Trnava. The 18th Brigade and the Posavina-Trebava Detachment were pushed into central Bosnia and temporarily placed under the command of the 53rd Division.

In mid-May, the 38th Division's headquarters, along with the 17th Brigade and the 16th Division, returned to Majevica to assist the 36th Division. However, due to strong enemy forces, all three divisions were forced to retreat to Mount Konjuh. By June, the division, with the 16th and 36th Divisions, regained control of the Majevica and Semberija regions, inflicting significant losses on German and Chetnik units in battles at Zajednica (elevation 443), Lopare, and other locations.

During July and August, the division, along with other units from the 3rd and 12th Corps, was caught in German clearing operations aimed at preventing the NOVJ units' advance into Serbia. Through skillful maneuvers, it avoided decisive clashes and, in September, participated in liberating several places in the Spreča Valley and Posavina. Due to a massive influx of new fighters, the 21st East Bosnian (Tuzla) Brigade was formed on September 19, 1944, in liberated Tuzla from battalions of the 17th Majevica, 18th Croatian Brigades, and the Tuzla Partisan Detachment.

In October, the division advanced towards Brčko, Bijeljina, and Zvornik, disrupting the German 13th SS Division "Handschar" and causing over 700 legionnaires to defect to the Partisans near Mioče on October 29. In November and December 1944, the division successfully fought against Chetniks and elements of the German Army Group E retreating north through the Drina Valley, particularly around Zvornik, Majevica, Brčko, and Bijeljina, and in the defense of Tuzla. On December 27, alongside the 27th Division, it defeated a group of eight Chetnik corps (about 8,000 men) near Tuzla.

Continuing operations in January and February 1945 in the lower Drina Valley, the division, with other 3rd Corps forces and parts of the 2nd Army, engaged in fierce battles against the German 22nd Infantry Division. On March 10, 1945, an Artillery Brigade was formed within the division on Romanija. The division liberated Olovo on March 25 and participated in the liberation of Sarajevo from March 28 to April 10, 1945. Until mid-May 1945, it was involved in the destruction of the main Chetnik forces of Draža Mihailović in southeastern Bosnia as part of the 3rd Corps.
