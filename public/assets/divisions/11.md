## Operations

The 11th Krajina Division, originally named the Twelfth Division of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ), was formed on June 1, 1943, by order of the Supreme Commander Josip Broz Tito. It was renamed the 11th Division three months later during a revision and unification of names.

### 1943 Operations

The division quickly became active in offensive operations around Banja Luka, which prompted the German commander in the Independent State of Croatia, General Rudolf Liters, to initiate Operation "Pfingsten" on June 13, 1943. This operation aimed to encircle and destroy the division using the 721st Jäger Regiment of the 114th Jäger Division and the "East" combat group, which included the reinforced 8th Jäger Home Guard Regiment and Chetnik detachments "Borja" and "Obilić." However, the operation failed as the 11th Krajina Division skillfully avoided encirclement and continued its offensive actions.

On July 10, 1943, the division, alongside the Second Krajina Brigade, defeated the Ustaša-Home Guard garrison in Prnjavor. Throughout the latter half of 1943, the division engaged in continuous battles against German, Ustaša-Home Guard, and Chetnik forces in central Bosnia. At the end of December 1943 and the beginning of January 1944, it participated in an attack on Banja Luka.

### 1944 Operations

Following the Banja Luka attack, the division faced significant losses during the German Operation "Napfkuhen." Despite this, on August 8, 1944, the division successfully crossed the Bosna River and, under constant combat with units of the 13th SS Division, managed to break through the Drina River into western Serbia by early September.

As part of the Twelfth Vojvodina Corps, the division took part in the Belgrade Operation. After receiving reinforcements from Serbia, the division continued its advance through Srem and engaged in fierce battles on the Srem Front. Following the breakthrough of the front, the division advanced along the Sava River valley towards Zagreb.

### 1945 Operations

In mid-May 1945, the division participated in the capture of the remnants of Army Group "E" in Slovenia, marking the end of its wartime operations.
