# 26. dalmatinska divizija NOVJ

## Formation
The 26th Dalmatian Division of the Yugoslav People's Army was formed on October 8, 1943. It was composed of the 11th, 12th and 13th brigades with around 3,800 fighters. In January 1944, the 1st Dalmatian Brigade replaced the 13th. In March 1944, the 3rd Overseas Brigade of the Yugoslav People's Army also joined the division.

From its establishment until the end of the war, the division was part of the 8th Dalmatian Corps. The operational area of ​​the 26th Division covered southern Dalmatia, Pelješac and the island archipelago: Hvar, Brač, Vis, Korčula and smaller islands. Due to the nature of its operational area, the division was assigned to close cooperation with the forces of the Yugoslav People's Navy.

## Operations
The operational area of ​​the division fell within the zone of the German 5th SS Corps of the 2nd Panzer Army. The territory of the 26th division was occupied by the 118th fighter division, and parts of the 7th SS and 369th legionary divisions also took part in the actions.

From October to December 1943, the division was engaged in heavy fighting for the defense of the free territory in Podbiokovlje, Pelješac and Korčula. During the "Herbstgewitter" operation on December 24, 1943, the first commander of the 26th division, the national hero Niko Martinović, was killed on Korčula.

Since January 1944, the 26th division has been in charge of the defense of Vis. After the decision was made to defend, Vis was turned into a real fortress with the help of the Allies. This prevented the Germans from landing on Vis.

From Vis, the division carried out raids on Hvar, Brač, Korčula and the coast. The landing on Korčula and Mljet in April 1944 was particularly successful. Some of the actions involved the Allied Navy and units of the Allied 2nd Special Service Brigade (Hvar in March, Šolta in May, Brač in June 1944).

In September 1944, the NOVJ offensive began to liberate Dalmatia, in which the 26th Division also participated. On September 8, the division liberated Hvar. It achieved significant success during the liberation of Brač, where a reinforced battalion of the 118th Division was destroyed.

The 26th Division was the first NOVJ division to be fully manned. In August 1944, its brigades numbered 2,000-2,400 fighters, and the division had a total of 8,670 fighters. From October 8, 1944, the 1st Tank Brigade NOVJ was also under its tactical and disciplinary command.

The 26th Division and the 1st Tank Brigade landed in mid-October on land in southern Dalmatia. This put the German and Ustasha crew in Dubrovnik in a difficult position. During the withdrawal, one column of the 369th division was destroyed by parts of the 26th NOVJ division in the battle at Vukovo Klanac.

After the concentration of the other forces of the 8th Corps, the Knin operation was launched, which liquidated the main stronghold on the right wing of the German "green line" of the front in Yugoslavia and destroyed the 264th division.

From March 20, 1945, the division, as part of the 4th Army, participated in the Lika-littoral and Trieste operations against the German 15th and 97th Mountain Corps, which were destroyed in these operations.
