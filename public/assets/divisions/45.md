## Operations

The 45th Serbian Division was established on September 3, 1944, in the village of Trgovište. Initially, it comprised the 20th Serbian Brigade, and later incorporated the 23rd and 24th Serbian Brigades. By April 1945, the division also included engineering, medical, and communications battalions, among others. At its formation, the division had about 2,100 fighters, which grew to approximately 5,300 by September 27, 1944, and reached 10,844 fighters by May 1, 1945.

Initially, the division was under the direct command of the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Serbia until September 13, 1944, after which it became part of the 14th Corps. The division played a significant role in the liberation of Eastern Serbia, operating in the areas of Niš, Svrljig, and Knjaževac in early September 1944. On September 8, it disarmed around 3,000 soldiers of the Bulgarian 24th Division in Runjevac and Jošanica. On September 11 and 12, it cut off the communication line between Niš and Zaječar, disrupting the supply lines of the German 1st Mountain Division in the Zaječar area.

Towards the end of September and the beginning of October, in cooperation with units of the Red Army, the division crossed the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border and threatened the rear of the German 1st Mountain Division in the Boljevac, Zaječar, and Knjaževac regions. During the Niš Operation, alongside elements of the 223rd Division of the Red Army, it captured Knjaževac and Aleksinac and advanced from Svrljig into Niš.

In November and December, the division engaged in battles along the Požega–Užice–Varda–Ljubovija line. During the winter operations in January 1945, it operated on the Zvornik–Bijeljina communication line. From February 8 to 12, the division defeated a strong group of Serbian and Montenegrin Chetniks, who, with the support of German forces and Ustaše, attempted to advance through the Spreča Valley into Tuzla.

In the final operations from April to May 1945, the division participated as part of the Second Army in the liberation of Doboj, Derventa, Bosanska Gradiška, Bosanska Dubica, Sisak, and Zagreb. Subsequently, it joined the Third Army in pursuing the enemy through Styria into Austria.
