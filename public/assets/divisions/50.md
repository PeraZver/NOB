## Operations
The 50th Macedonian Division was an integral part of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ) and played a significant role in the liberation efforts during World War II. Initially formed on September 17, 1944, in the village of Mitrašinci near Berovo, the division was composed of several Macedonian brigades. Shortly after its formation, the division became part of the Bregalnica-Strumica Corps.

In October 1944, the division engaged in combat against German units along the Valandovo-Strumica-Berovo route. It successfully liberated the towns of Berovo and Pehčevo on October 13, followed by Kočane on October 22. Continuing its offensive, the division liberated villages in the Bregalnica River valley and captured the town of Štip on November 8, and Sveti Nikole on November 9.

The division's operations were crucial in the broader campaign to liberate Macedonia from Axis occupation. During the battles for the liberation of Skopje, the division fought near the Matka hydroelectric plant and subsequently liberated Tetovo on November 19, 1944.

Despite its successes, the 50th Macedonian Division was disbanded in December 1944, marking the end of its active engagement in the war.
