## Operations

The 16th Vojvodina Division, formed on July 2, 1943, in Eastern Bosnia, was a key unit of the Yugoslav Partisan movement. Initially comprising the First, Second, and Third Vojvodina Brigades, the division quickly expanded, incorporating additional brigades over time.

### 1943 Operations
In its early operations, the division played a significant role during the final phase of the Fifth Enemy Offensive in July 1943. It supported the breakthrough of the First Proletarian Division, engaging in fierce battles against German and Ustaše forces along the Zvornik-Tuzla line and near Šekovići. On July 5, 1943, in cooperation with the First Proletarian Brigade, the division successfully defeated a battalion of the German 369th Legionnaire Division and other enemy units, liberating Zvornik.

Throughout August and September 1943, the division continued its offensive, liberating several towns including Bijeljina and Zvornik, and repelling enemy forces from Puračić and Lukavac. However, an unsuccessful attack on the German-Ustaše garrison in Brčko on October 19 marked a temporary setback.

### 1944 Operations
In early 1944, the division was involved in multiple operations, including a failed attempt to capture Tuzla in January. Despite this, they continued to engage enemy forces, clearing areas of Chetnik presence and disrupting enemy communications.

By mid-1944, the division was part of the Twelfth Vojvodina Corps, participating in operations across Bosnia and Montenegro. Notably, in September 1944, the division crossed into Serbia, liberating towns such as Krupanj and Loznica, and engaging in significant battles against Chetnik and German forces.

### 1945 Operations
In the final months of the war, the division was heavily engaged in operations across the Drava River and participated in the liberation of several towns in Croatia, including Valpovo and Donji Miholjac. By April 1945, the division was involved in the liberation of Našice, Podravska Slatina, and Virovitica, and pursued retreating enemy forces towards Celje.

The division's war path concluded in May 1945, when it was transported to Slovenia and Austria, participating in the disarmament of German divisions northeast of Celje. The division's final operations took place in Slovenia, where it remained until the end of the war.
