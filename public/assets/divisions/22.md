## Operations

The 22nd Serbian Division, initially named the Second Serbian Division, was a significant unit of the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II. Upon its formation on May 22, 1944, the division was composed of the Eighth, Tenth, and Twelfth Serbian Brigades. It temporarily included the First Vlasotince Brigade from September 12 to October 14, 1944, and later formed an Artillery Brigade on March 17, 1945. The division's strength grew from 2,000 fighters at its inception to 5,925 in December 1944, and 7,810 by March 1945. It was designated as an "assault" division on January 17, 1945.

Initially, the division operated under the command of the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Serbia until September 6, 1944. It then became part of the Thirteenth Serbian Corps and, from December 7, 1944, until the end of the war, returned to the command of the Main Staff of Serbia, except for a brief period from April 7 to April 16, 1945, when it was under the First Army of the Yugoslav Army.

### Key Operations and Battles

From May 23 to 28, 1944, the division, alongside the 21st Serbian Division, engaged in significant battles in Gornja Jablanica, defeating the Jablanički, Južnomoravski, and Vardarski Corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVuO). On the night of June 14/15, it participated in an attack on Leskovac with the 13th Brigade, the 24th Division, and the Bulgarian Partisan Battalion "Georgi Dimitrov," against Bulgarian units, a battalion of Germans, and parts of the Serbian Volunteer Corps. The division captured the railway station, destroyed the power plant, and withdrew at dawn.

From July 9 to 11, the division cleared the Babička Gora and Zaplanje of Chetniks, conducted sabotage on the Leskovac–Vranje railway, and entered Vranje and Bujanovac on September 8, and Pirot, Babušnica, Caribrod, and Bosiljgrad on September 11. On September 30, it captured Vlasotince and participated in the Niš operation as part of the 13th Corps. On October 14, the division expelled elements of the 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen" from Bubanj and Turski šanac, being the first to enter the southern part of Niš around 1 PM and continued fighting to liberate the city by 4 PM.

### Late War Operations

During the Kosovo Operation, the division's Eighth Brigade, along with parts of the Bulgarian Fourth Division, liberated Vučitrn on November 20, and the Twelfth Brigade, with elements of the Bulgarian Tank Brigade, liberated Kosovska Mitrovica on November 22. Subsequently, the division liberated Raška and Novi Pazar on November 29 and 30.

In February 1945, the division was stationed on the right bank of the Drina River near Koviljača to Culina during the Second Army's operations on the left bank. Later, as part of the First Army, it participated in the breakthrough of the Srem Front from the Batrovci–Sveti Luka sector, crossed the Bosut River on April 11, liberated Lipovac the next day, crossed the Spačva River, and captured Apševce.
