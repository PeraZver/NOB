## Operations

The 15th Slovenian Division was formed on July 13, 1943, in Dolenjske Toplice. Shortly after its formation, the division, in cooperation with the 14th Slovenian Division, launched an attack on the Italian stronghold of Žužemberk on July 24, 1943. This assault escalated into several days of street fighting, followed by a challenging withdrawal in the face of a concentrated attack by significantly superior Italian forces. During these battles, on July 30, 1943, the division's first commander, Predrag Jevtić, a national hero, was killed.

Following the capitulation of Italy, the division disarmed all Italian forces and a significant portion of the White Guard between Novo Mesto and the suburbs of Ljubljana. Utilizing the captured weaponry, artillery batteries were established within all three brigades of the 15th Division, equipped with 65 mm and 75 mm guns. The division's command decided to form a divisional artillery unit, with the first artillery battery established on September 11, under the leadership of Lieutenant Miha Mišič. This battery was expanded into a battalion with eight guns, including howitzers and anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. By the end of the month, this battalion was reorganized into the Artillery of the 15th Division, which later became the foundation for the First Slovenian Artillery Brigade.

From October 3, 1943, until the end of the war, the division was part of the 7th Slovenian Corps. During this period, the "Slavko Šlander" Brigade was detached, and the 12th and 15th Slovenian Brigades, along with an artillery detachment, were added. The division's strength increased to over 5,600 fighters, further bolstered by the inclusion of the 14th "Railway" Brigade.

In early October 1943, the division attacked German positions from the Temeniška Valley to Kostanjevica and the Gorjanci Mountains. It was caught in the German October "Rommel" offensive, suffering significant losses. In November, the division blockaded the German garrison in Novo Mesto and fought against German attempts to break the blockade. It also operated in Bela Krajina and along the Kočevje—Ljubljana railway line.

Throughout 1944, the division focused on destroying German and White Guard strongholds along the Črnomelj-Novo Mesto and Črnomelj-Metlika routes. Notable actions included the destruction of Home Guard forces in Zdenska Vas and Sv. Anton from February 28 to 29, the liberation of Dobrava and Dobrnič from April 30 to May 1, the liberation of Žužemberk from May 2 to 4, Trebnje from May 15 to 17, and Mirna Peč on May 19 and 20. The division also participated in the destruction of the Štampetov Bridge on June 12/13, 1944.

The division, along with the 13th Primorsko-Goranska Division, liberated Bosiljevo on June 29/30 and defended the free territory in Bela Krajina with the 4th Croatian Corps in early July. By late December 1944 and early 1945, the division included the Italian Fontanot Brigade and the First Austrian Partisan Battalion. In 1945, the division alternated with the 18th Slovenian Division in operations around Novo Mesto and Gorjanci, particularly in Suha Krajina, where it endured heavy losses in April. After liberating Kočevje, the division participated in the liberation of Ljubljana from May 7 to 9, 1945, when it was declared an assault division.
