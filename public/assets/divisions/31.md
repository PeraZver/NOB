## Operations

The 31st Slovenian Division, initially formed as the 26th Triglav Division, was actively engaged in operations in the region of Gorenjska, west of the Sava River, and in the areas of Idrija-Cerkno and Tolmin. In the latter half of October 1943, the division successfully eliminated several smaller German strongholds in western Gorenjska, specifically in the Selska and Poljanska valleys. However, a German offensive from November 13 to 20, 1943, posed a significant challenge. Despite the strength of the German forces, the division adeptly maneuvered out of a German encirclement near Cerkno, retreating to the Šentviška plateau with minimal losses.

The division faced further challenges in December 1943 and January 1944, when German troops, trained in partisan warfare tactics, launched surprise attacks. These attacks nearly annihilated the Third Battalion of the Seventh Brigade "France Prešeren" at Pokljuka on December 15, and inflicted heavy losses on a battalion of the Third Brigade "Ivan Gradnik" and the Party School in Cerkno on January 27, 1944. In response, the division increased its vigilance and strength, mobilizing 1,500 new fighters between January and May 1944.

On the night of February 5-6, 1944, a sabotage group from the division infiltrated the mercury mine in Idrija, destroying equipment and halting operations. By late March 1944, the division, alongside other units of the Ninth Corps, attacked enemy strongholds in the Idrija sector. In mid-April, they targeted the Postojna—Trieste railway line, causing significant disruptions between Logatec and Košana. Notable sabotage actions included the destruction of a cinema hall in Villa Opicina on April 2 and an officers' mess in Trieste later that month, resulting in substantial German casualties.

Among the division's significant achievements was the expansion of liberated territory in Gorenjska, capturing numerous enemy positions in the Bohinj Valley and around Bled by late May. They also destroyed sections of the Gorizia—Jesenice railway after three days of fighting in Baška grapa in late June and early July. The division captured strongholds in Hotavlje on July 18, Črni Vrh on September 1, Poljana on October 1, and Železniki on November 23.

In the final months of the war, the division, with other Ninth Corps units, withstood intense consecutive attacks from strong German and collaborationist forces in the Corps' operational area. During the last enemy offensive in late March and early April 1945, which involved over 30,000 enemy troops across the Slovenian Littoral and western Gorenjska, the division suffered significant losses, with over 600 killed, wounded, or missing. Nevertheless, by mid-April, they launched a counteroffensive, clearing Trnovski gozd of enemy forces, advancing west into the Soča Valley, and liberating Gorizia and Monfalcone on May 1, 1945, ahead of the arrival of Anglo-American units.
