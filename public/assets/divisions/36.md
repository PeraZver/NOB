## Operations

### Early Operations and Movements
The 36th Vojvodina Division was initially engaged in battles against the German 13th SS Division in the regions of Semberija and Majevica in March and early April 1944. On April 18, 1944, the division moved across the Zvornik-Tuzla road into the Birač area, aiming to facilitate the transfer of the 16th and 17th Divisions into Serbia. However, an attack by the German 7th SS Division "Prinz Eugen" and the 3rd Home Guard Brigade thwarted this plan, forcing the division to retreat alongside the 16th and 38th Divisions from April 25 to 30, 1944, to the Kladanj area.

### Mid-1944 Operations
In May 1944, the division was tasked with securing the hospital of the 12th Vojvodina Corps, frequently crossing the Zvornik-Tuzla line and engaging in heavy battles against German and Ustaše forces in the Lopare, Tuzla, and Konjuh Mountain regions. By July, the division was active in the Majevica and Orahovica areas and later moved to the Spreča River Valley and Olovo region.

### Durmitor Operation and Transition to Serbia
In August 1944, the division participated in the Durmitor Operation, enduring harsh conditions and continuous combat while marching across Bosnian, Montenegrin, and Herzegovinian mountains. On September 5/6, 1944, the division crossed the Drina River at Stari Brod and entered Serbia, advancing over Mount Tara towards Cer. By mid-October, they defeated strong Chetnik forces on Mount Medvednik and, after a brief rest and reinforcement near Valjevo, contributed to the liberation of Rađevina, Pocerina, Mačva, and Obrenovac, eventually participating in the liberation of Belgrade.

### Late 1944 and Srem Front
In October 1944, the Sixth Vojvodina Brigade joined the division near Belgrade. After defeating German forces in the Umka area, the division crossed the Sava River into Srem on October 21/22, 1944, continuing to pursue German forces. They liberated Stara Pazova and Irig from October 23 to 26, participated in the liberation of Ruma on October 27, and Sremska Mitrovica on November 1. By mid-November, the division was relocated to Novi Sad and then to the left bank of the Danube to defend the Apatin-Bačka Palanka front.

### Final Operations and Conclusion of War Path
In December 1944, the division supported units on the Srem Front, capturing Opatovac and Mohovo. By late December, they moved into Hungary, securing positions on the left bank of the Drava near Donji Miholjac and at the Virovitica bridgehead from January 13 to 18, 1945. After intense battles near Pitomača, the division withdrew to the left bank of the Drava by February 10, 1945, due to strong German counterattacks. In March, they helped eliminate a German bridgehead on the Drava and crossed the river near Narde on April 11/12, 1945.

In the final operations for the liberation of Yugoslavia, the division liberated Valpovo on April 12, broke a German column between Bračevci and Razbojište on April 15, and liberated Našice on April 16, Podravska Slatina on April 20, Virovitica on April 25, Koprivnica on May 5, Ludbreg on May 6, and Varaždin and Varaždinske Toplice on May 7. The division concluded its war path by capturing a German-Ustaše-Chetnik group near Dravograd on May 15, 1945.
