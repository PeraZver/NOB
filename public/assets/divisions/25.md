## Operations

### Initial Engagements (June - September 1944)
The 25th Serbian Division was initially engaged in combat against the Rasina-Toplica and South Morava Corps groups of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVuO) in the regions of Toplica and Jablanica in June 1944. In July, they fought against elements of the Bulgarian 27th Division and the Fourth Assault Corps group of the JVuO during the Toplica-Jablanica operation. By August, the division was active in the South Morava Valley and on Babička Gora, engaging Chetnik, Bulgarian, and German units.

### Coordination with the Red Army (September - October 1944)
In early September 1944, the division moved from the Boljevac region, advancing towards Donji Milanovac, where they launched an unsuccessful attack on September 11. Anticipating the arrival of the Red Army, the division liberated Kučevo from Chetnik forces on September 21 and established contact with the 109th Rifle Regiment of the 113th Division of the Red Army on September 24 near the village of Miroč. From October 1 to 12, the division participated in the liberation of eastern Serbia, collaborating with the 75th and 68th Rifle Corps of the Red Army and engaging in heavy battles against the German "Stettner" Corps group.

### Operations in Eastern Serbia and Beyond (November 1944 - April 1945)
In November 1944, the division was dispatched to the Kraljevo region to conduct joint operations with the Second Proletarian Division of the NOVJ against the German "Miller" Corps group. They crossed the Ibar River on November 29 near Mataruga, capturing the villages of Kaona and Arilje. By December 13, they had liberated Požega and subsequently Užice on December 16.

### Final Operations and the End of the War (January - May 1945)
In January 1945, the 25th Division joined operations with the Second Yugoslav Army, distinguishing itself in mid-March by destroying a German battalion near Srebrenik on the northwestern slopes of Majevica. This action secured the right flank of the main forces of the Second Yugoslav Army during the crossing of the Bosna River. After crossing the Drina River on April 18, the division moved to the Vučijak Mountain area, attacking a strong group of Chetniks, Ustaše, and Domobrans threatening the flank and rear of the Second Yugoslav Army. From April 29 to May 8, the division marched over 300 kilometers from Odžak to Zagreb, where it was immediately engaged in the final battles in the wider Zagreb area.
