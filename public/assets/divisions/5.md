## Operations

The 5th Krajina Division was formed on November 9, 1942, at Glamočko polje by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. Initially composed of the First, Fourth, and Seventh Krajina Brigades, the division quickly became involved in offensive operations against German and Ustaše forces in the Sana and Una valleys by late November and December 1942.

In early 1943, during Operation "Weiss I," the division successfully halted the advance of the German 749th Regiment of the 717th Division. Later, during Operation "Weiss II," it conducted a successful elastic defense against the advancing 7th SS Division and the 369th Legionary Division. Throughout 1943, the division executed several successful attacks, notably capturing Kakanj in June and launching an assault on the Rajlovac airfield in August.

By December 1943, the division engaged in intense maneuver warfare against the 5th SS Corps during Operation "Kugelblitz" in eastern Bosnia. From March to May 1944, the division advanced through Serbia and engaged in battles against German forces, Chetniks, and the Muslim Legion in Sandžak and eastern Bosnia.

In August 1944, the 5th Krajina Division fought under the direct command of the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Serbia, participating in the Battle of Kopaonik and battles in the Western Morava Valley. From October 1944 to April 1945, the division was involved in the Srem Front battles. On January 17, 1945, during an offensive by the German 34th Army Corps, the division suffered heavy losses, with some units being scattered.

In April 1945, the division played a crucial role in breaking through the Srem Front and liberating Slavonski Brod. Throughout its service, the 5th Krajina Division was considered one of the elite units of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia.
