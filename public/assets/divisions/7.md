## Operations

The 7th Banija Division was a prominent unit of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, formed on November 22, 1942, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ). Initially comprising the 7th and 8th Banija Brigades and the 13th Croatian Brigade Josip Kraš, the division saw the 16th Banija Brigade replace the 13th Brigade on December 26, 1942, due to operational constraints.

### Early Operations and the Battle of Neretva

The division was part of the 1st Croatian Corps, later the 4th Croatian Corps, and operated primarily in the Banija region. From January to July 1943, it was incorporated into an Operational Group of Divisions under the Supreme Headquarters, participating in the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensives. During Operation Weiss I, the division disrupted the advance of the 369th Legionary Division across Banija, but had to reposition to the right bank of the Una River on January 24, 1943, due to the flanking maneuver by the 7th SS Division.

In Operation Weiss II, known as the Battle of Neretva, the division engaged in defensive battles to prevent the German-Ustasha "Vogel" group from advancing towards Prozor. During the Battle of Sutjeska, starting June 3, 1943, the division was part of the Southern Group, tasked with crossing the Tara River into Sandžak. When this proved impossible, the division was ordered on June 8 to march swiftly across the Sutjeska River to join the Northern Group. They crossed just in time before the German "Gertler" group closed the encirclement, resulting in the capture and execution of around 200 wounded and medical personnel by German forces.

### Reorganization and Later Campaigns

After breaking through Zelengora, the division fought in eastern and central Bosnia until August 1943 under direct command of the Supreme Headquarters. Returning to Banija in early September 1943, the division was reorganized. The 7th and 8th Banija Brigades were renamed the 1st and 2nd Brigades, while the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Una Operational Group became the 3rd and 4th Brigades of the division. It also incorporated Jewish and Italian battalions, joining the 4th Croatian Corps.

Operating in Banija, the division achieved significant successes against German and Ustasha forces, inflicting substantial losses through frequent diversions and attacks on communication lines. During Operation Panther in December 1943, the division liberated Glina on January 11, 1944. In May, it faced the German Operation Chess. By mid-August, the division's headquarters and two brigades moved to Moslavina to assist the 10th Zagreb Corps, while the remaining forces continued operations in Banija.

In October 1944, two brigades of the 7th Division, along with elements of the 6th Slavonian Corps and the 10th Zagreb Corps, attacked the Ustasha garrison in Koprivnica. During the final operations, the division was subordinated to the 4th Army Headquarters, participating in the Trieste operation.

In recognition of its achievements and sacrifices, the division was designated as "shock" (udarna) in September 1943, and its three brigades were awarded the Order of the People's Hero.
