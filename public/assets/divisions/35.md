## Operations

The 35th Lika Division was formed on January 30, 1944, as part of the 11th Croatian Corps of the Yugoslav Partisan movement. Initially, the division engaged in minor attacks in the Otočac region during February and March 1944, successfully repelling frequent incursions by the 4th Ustaša Brigade into the free territory of Lika. The division fought fierce battles against Ustaša and German forces at Ramljani, Široka Kula, and Gostovača, and on the night of March 30/31, in the villages around Otočac.

On April 22, 1944, elements of the division repelled an attack by parts of the 846th Regiment of the German 392nd Legionnaire Division and the 19th Ustaša Battalion near Babin Potok. From April 26 to May 2, they engaged in intense fighting in the areas of Crna Vlast, Vrhovine, and Zalužnica. On May 5, they defeated the 35th Ustaša Battalion and liberated Ramljani, threatening enemy communications on the Otočac–Gospić route.

In response, the German 15th Mountain Army Corps launched Operation "Morgenstern" on May 7, 1944, involving nine battalions from the German 392nd and 373rd Legionnaire Divisions, the 4th Ustaša Brigade, the 1st Brandenburg Regiment, the 92nd Motorized Regiment, and the Chetnik Medak Detachment. This operation aimed to destroy the 35th Division and parts of the 8th Kordun Division and seize the free territory of Lika. Despite the enemy's temporary control and devastation of the area, the 35th and 8th Divisions avoided decisive conflicts and recaptured Krbavsko Polje and Korenica by May 20, saving around 200 wounded and over 12,000 civilians by relocating them to Velebit.

In June 1944, the division fought against elements of the German 392nd Legionnaire Division and the 4th Ustaša Brigade, who were making incursions from Vrhovine, Perušić, Gospić, and Gračac. On June 15, 1944, the division underwent reorganization: its 2nd Brigade was disbanded, and the 3rd Brigade of the 13th Division and the 3rd Brigade of the 19th Division joined as its Second and Third Brigades, respectively. The Battalion "Plavi Jadran" left the division, which then had 3,438 fighters.

On July 4, 1944, the division captured Ličko Petrovo Selo. On July 9, with the support of Allied aviation, they attacked the 4th Ustaša Brigade and parts of the 3rd Home Guard Garrison Brigade, capturing Ribnik, Budak, Široka Kula, and Perušić, pushing the enemy west of the Otočac–Gospić communication line. A counterattack by three battalions of the German 392nd Legionnaire Division and five battalions of the 4th Ustaša Brigade on July 10 pushed the division to the northwestern edge of Krbavsko Polje by July 14. However, the division's units launched a strong assault, forcing the enemy to retreat to their initial garrisons.

Continuing operations on the Bihać–Vrhovine communication line, the division liberated Prijeboj on July 17, reconnecting the free territories of Lika and Kordun. On August 7, the division ambushed and destroyed a German column of 26 trucks on the Donji Lapac–Dobroselo road. On August 8, approximately 6,000 enemy troops (Germans, Ustaša, and Chetniks) began an attack on the 35th Division and parts of the 8th Division at Krbavsko Polje, leading to heavy fighting as enemy forces traversed the entire free territory of Lika.

From September 5 to 7, 1944, the division engaged in heavy fighting in the Bihać and Ljubovo areas, breaking a company of the 19th Ustaša Battalion and 40 members of the Ustaša Militia in Dabar on September 6. They liberated Škare and Glavace near Otočac on September 7, Kosinj on September 15, and Široka Kula, Janjče, Lički Osik, and Perušić on September 21. However, due to a counterattack by stronger Ustaša forces, the division withdrew to Krbavsko Polje. On October 4, they recaptured Široka Kula, attacked Ustaša and German garrisons in Vrhovine on October 7, and on October 14, defeated parts of the 31st and 34th Ustaša Battalions near Široka Kula, although a counterattack by about 800 Ustaša from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Ustaša Brigade forced them back.

On November 15, 1944, the division liberated Lovinac. On December 19, together with parts of the 13th Division, they destroyed a German combined detachment of about 1,400 soldiers near Gračac, liberating the town and inflicting 260 enemy fatalities, 45 wounded, and capturing 826. A large quantity of military equipment was seized. For this success, the 35th Division was commended on December 14, 1944, by the Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Partisans, Josip Broz Tito. On December 20, 1944, the division was declared an "Assault Division" by the Main Staff of the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Croatia.

On January 6, 1945, the division fought near Plitvički Ljeskovac. From February 11 to 18, they, along with the 13th and 8th Divisions, repelled strong German and Ustaša-Home Guard forces' attacks near Ličko Petrovo Selo, Drežnik-Grad, and Lička Jesenica. On March 16, together with units of the 8th Division, they liberated Selište, Čatrnja, and Smoljanac (near Drežnik-Grad) after three days of fighting, pushing German forces towards Ličko Petrovo Selo and inflicting 87 enemy fatalities, 125 wounded, and capturing 43. From March 20 to 28, the 35th Division participated in the liberation of Bihać.

Shortly thereafter, the division was disbanded on April 2, 1945. Its First Brigade was renamed the First Independent Lika Brigade, and fighters from the 2nd and 3rd Assault Brigades were reassigned to units of the 13th Primorje-Gorski Kotar Division and the 11th Corps of the Yugoslav Army.
