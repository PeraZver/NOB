## Operations

The 46th Serbian Division was formed on September 20, 1944, in the Pirot region and initially included the 25th, 26th, and 27th Serbian Brigades. By the end of October 1944, the division expanded to include additional units such as support, reconnaissance, engineering, and communication companies, as well as a hospital, logistics, music, and cultural teams, bringing its strength to about 5,600 fighters.

From its formation until December 3, 1944, the division was part of the Thirteenth Corps. It was then placed under the command of the Main Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Serbia. From February 8, 1945, until the end of the war, it was under the command of the Operational Staff for Kosovo and Metohija.

In early October 1944, the division was active in the Grdelica Gorge and Vranje areas. It collaborated with the Bulgarian Second Cavalry Division and later with the Bulgarian First Partisan Division to block the route from Vranje to Niš. On October 11, 1944, the 25th and 27th Brigades liberated Vranje from the German 122nd Reinforced Reconnaissance Battalion of the Eleventh Division. Simultaneously, other division forces, along with parts of the Bulgarian First Partisan Division, attacked and liberated Belo Polje and the Mačkatica mine on October 12-13.

The division then operated alongside the Bulgarian Second Cavalry Division on the Bujanovac–Gnjilane axis, capturing Bujanovac on November 8 and Gnjilane on November 16, 1944. Throughout November, the division participated in the liberation of Kosovo and remained there until the end of the war. Its tasks included eliminating Ballist and other Albanian collaborationist forces, consolidating people's power, and ensuring mobilization from the area.

By February 12, 1945, the division's strength had increased to 7,314 soldiers, and by May 15, 1945, it had 6,130 soldiers. The division played a crucial role in securing liberated territories and supporting the establishment of new administrative structures in post-war Yugoslavia.
