## Operations

### Initial Operations and the Niš Operation
The 47th Serbian Division was formed on October 1, 1944, near Lebane. Upon its formation, it was part of the 13th Corps. The division quickly became involved in the Niš Operation, operating from the region south and southwest of Leskovac along the left bank of the Južna Morava River towards Niš. The division began combat operations on October 8 and successfully liberated the town of Leskovac by October 11.

### Engagements in October 1944
Continuing its advance towards the Toplica River, the division, with artillery support from the Bulgarian Tank Brigade, captured the villages of Kočane and Čečina on October 12. By October 13, the division had crossed the Toplica River. In collaboration with the 24th Division, it managed to encircle the retreating German 7th SS Division in the Dobričko field on October 14. With the support of the Red Army's aviation and the Bulgarian Tank Brigade's Motorized Detachment, the division inflicted a decisive defeat on the German forces near the villages of Mramor and Jug-Bogdanovac, largely destroying them.

### Clearing Operations and Final Movements
By the end of October, the division was engaged in clearing operations in the areas of Jastrebac, Toplica, and Kosanica. From November onwards, it operated in eastern Serbia and later around Kragujevac and Kraljevo, focusing on eliminating remnants of Chetnik units.

### Transfer and Disbandment
In early May 1945, the 47th Serbian Division was transferred to Slavonski Brod as part of the First Army. It was subsequently disbanded, and its personnel were reassigned to other units.
