## Operations

The 42nd Macedonian Division was formed on September 7, 1944, in the village of Lisiče near Veles. Initially, it comprised the Third, Eighth, and Twelfth Macedonian Assault Brigades. By the second half of November 1944, the division had grown to include 4,136 fighters and officers. In mid-October 1944, the division became part of the Sixteenth Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

The division operated in the broader area around Skopje, engaging in battles against German and Ballist forces along the routes to Veles and the Skopje-Tetovo communication lines. On November 9, 1944, the division's units liberated Veles, and shortly thereafter, on November 13, 1944, they participated in the liberation of Skopje. In December, the division was involved in the battles for the liberation of Kosovo.

At the beginning of January 1945, the division was reinforced with the Third and Sixteenth Macedonian Assault Brigades, the Seventh Albanian Brigade, and the First Macedonian Artillery Brigade. Subsequently, the division became part of the Fifteenth Corps of NOVJ. It took part in the battles on the Srem Front and the final operations for the liberation of Yugoslavia.

The command structure of the division saw Kosta Jašmakov serving as the commander until December 6, 1944, after which Milivoje Grozdanić took over. The political commissars included Boro Čaušev - Strandžata, Jonče Fotevski, and Rade Gogov - Crnorečki, with Beno Ruso assuming the role on January 6, 1945.
