## Operations

The 51st Macedonian Division was formed on October 19, 1944, in the village of Širok Dol near Berovo. At its inception, the division consisted of the First, 20th, and 21st Macedonian Brigades, along with an Artillery Brigade, totaling 2,476 fighters and officers. Under the command of Kiril Mihajlovski, a national hero, the division was part of the Bregalnica-Strumica Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

The division played a significant role in the operations for the liberation of Macedonia. It was actively engaged in securing key communication lines, including the routes from Dojran to Valandovo, Strumica, and Radoviš, as well as from Strumica to Novo Selo and the Bulgarian border. Through these operations, the division contributed to the liberation of Strumica and Radoviš.

Following these successful operations, the division was positioned along the Yugoslav border, stretching from Gevgelija to the tri-border area with Bulgaria. This strategic deployment was part of the broader efforts to secure the newly liberated territories. However, the division's active service was relatively short-lived, as it was disbanded in December 1944, after achieving its objectives in the region.
