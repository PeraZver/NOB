## Operations

The 17th East Bosnian Division was formed on July 2, 1943, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. Initially, the division was composed of the 6th East Bosnian NOU Brigade, the 15th Majevica NOU Brigade, and the Majevica NOP Detachment. The division's leadership included Commander Gligorije Mandić and Political Commissar Branko Petričević.

### Early Operations (July 1943 - September 1943)
From its formation until September 20, 1943, the division was directly subordinated to the Supreme Headquarters. During this period, the division engaged in operations in Eastern Bosnia. On September 21, 1943, the 16th Muslim Brigade was incorporated into the division.

### Transition to the 3rd Corps (September 1943 - May 1944)
After September 20, 1943, the division became part of the 3rd Corps. It played a significant role in the liberation of Tuzla in October 1943, which led to the capture of a substantial amount of weapons and equipment. This success allowed for the formation of additional units, including an artillery battery and an anti-tank battery.

By October 1943, the division had approximately 3,000 fighters. However, by May 1944, the number had decreased to around 1,800 fighters. In March 1944, the 16th Muslim Brigade was transferred to the 27th Division, and the 2nd Krajina NOU Brigade joined the 17th Division.

### Operations in Sandžak and Serbia (May 1944 - October 1944)
From mid-May to mid-June 1944, the division was again under the direct command of the Supreme Headquarters and conducted operations in Sandžak alongside the 5th Assault Division. From mid-June to the end of October 1944, the division was part of the 2nd Corps and an Operational Group of Divisions (2nd, 5th, and 17th) tasked with advancing into Serbia.

### Final Operations and End of War (November 1944 - May 1945)
In November 1944, the division came under the command of the Main Staff for Serbia. From December 1944 to April 1, 1945, it was part of the Southern Operational Group and the 2nd Army. During April 1945, it was involved in operations in Srem and Posavina as part of an Operational Group of Divisions under the 1st Army. From April 23 until the end of the war, the division was part of the 3rd Army.

Throughout its service, the division's strength fluctuated significantly. After the liberation of Gornji Milanovac in September 1944, the division's numbers increased to approximately 10,000 fighters. In October 1944, an Artillery Brigade was added to the division's composition.
