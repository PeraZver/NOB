## Operations

The 41st Macedonian Division was formed on August 25, 1944, in the village of Šeškovo near Kavadarci. Initially, it comprised the Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Macedonian Brigades, with the Eleventh Macedonian Assault Brigade joining later. By mid-October 1944, the division became part of the Fifteenth Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

The division's combat journey began with engagements against retreating enemy forces from Greece, participating in battles around Tikveš, Povardarje, Prilep, and the Vardar River valley. During its operations, the division played a significant role in the liberation of Prilep on November 2, 1944, capturing approximately 300 German soldiers and seizing around 60 military vehicles and equipment.

In December 1944, the division was reinforced with the Eighth, Twelfth, and Seventeenth Macedonian Assault Brigades. It continued its operations, contributing to the final battles for the liberation of Kosovo, where it fought against the remnants of ballistic forces. By the end of its wartime path, the division's strength had grown to 5,181 fighters and officers.

Throughout its service, the division underwent several leadership changes. Tihomir Miloševski was the initial commander, succeeded by Naum Vasilevski on September 25, 1944, and later by Metodija Popovski-Majka on December 6, 1944. The political commissar role was initially held by Naum Naumovski - Borče, followed by Stojan Bočvarov from September 25, 1944, and later by Đore Simonovski from December 6, 1944.
