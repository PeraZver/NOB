## Operations

The 48th Macedonian Division was formed on September 28, 1944, in the village of Plasnica near Kičevo. Shortly after its formation, in mid-October 1944, the division became part of the Fifteenth Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

### Liberation of Macedonian Cities

The division played a significant role in the liberation of several key Macedonian cities. On November 7, 1944, it participated in the liberation of Ohrid, followed by the liberation of Struga on November 8, 1944. The division also successfully liberated the towns of Kičevo and Gostivar.

### Reorganization and Further Engagements

In early January 1945, the division underwent reorganization, incorporating the First, Second, and Fourteenth Macedonian Brigades, as well as the Second Artillery Brigade. This reorganization bolstered its strength and capability for further operations.

### Breakthrough of the Srem Front

The division was actively involved in the breakthrough of the Srem Front, a critical operation in the final stages of the war. It participated in various battles that were pivotal for the ultimate liberation of Yugoslavia.

### Conclusion of Operations

The division concluded its operations in the towns of Celje and Dravograd. During its return to Macedonia, the division was engaged in operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it participated in clearing the area of remaining Chetnik and Ustaše formations.

Throughout its service, the 48th Macedonian Division demonstrated resilience and played a crucial role in the liberation efforts within Yugoslavia during World War II.
