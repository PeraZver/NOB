## Operations

### Areas of Operation
The division operated across northern Posočje (Kobarid–Bovec), Brda, Beneška Slovenia, the Resia valley, and later the Karst, Vipava Valley, Trnovski Gozd, and the Slovenian Littoral. Its activities spanned sabotage operations, attacks on enemy supply routes, destruction of strongholds, and major defensive battles against German and collaborationist forces.

### Late 1943 Operations
In November 1943, the division fought in Beneška Slovenia and upper Posočje. During the first half of December, it destroyed communications in Baška Grapa and the Soča Valley, culminating in the destruction of the Cave del Predil (Rabelj) mine on December 18.

### Winter 1944 Operations
In January 1944, the division engaged German units that had penetrated the Banjska Plateau and Trnovski Gozd. In February it carried out a twenty-day operation in Beneška Slovenia, returning afterward to the area of Mount Krn and the Šentviška Plateau. It operated around Hotedršica in mid-March, and in April expanded its actions around Idrija and the Cerkljansko region. In May, the division targeted German traffic between Razdrto and Senožeče and between Ajdovščina and Gorica. At the end of May, it liquidated several home guard strongholds including Dornberk, Tabor, Prvačina, and Volča Draga, followed by the elimination of the Razdrto stronghold on June 5.

### Summer 1944 Offensive Actions
During the general NOV Slovenia offensive in June, the division distinguished itself by destroying bridges near Avče and Kanal, carrying out major railway sabotage on the Podbrdo–Gorica line (June 14–16), and destroying infrastructure and fortified positions in Baška Grapa (June 29–July 3). After the successful attack on the home guard stronghold at Hotavlje (night of July 18/19), the division entered a prolonged phase of heavy battles against German and Quisling forces across Cerkno, Idrija, Čepovan, and Trnovo, lasting until mid-August.

From mid-August onward, operations focused on disrupting communications in the Vipava Valley. On September 1, the division took part, as a component of the Ninth Corps, in the liquidation of the Črni Vrh stronghold. This was followed by renewed operations on the Karst and in the Vipava Valley, including especially hard fighting around Štanjel from September 7 to 10. Meanwhile, the 17th Brigade operated independently from August 10 to November 1944 in northern Posočje and Beneška Slovenia.

### Late 1944: Defensive Actions Against German Offensives
Throughout the autumn and winter of 1944, German forces repeatedly attempted to penetrate the free territory of the Slovenian Littoral. The division responded in October with fighting around Predmeja, Otlica, Col, and Črni Vrh; in November around Trnov; and in December throughout the Trnovo Plateau and the Čepovanska Valley.

### Early 1945 Operations
In January 1945, the division once again held defensive positions along the Grgar–Trnovo–Otlica line. In a counterattack from January 18 to 21, it annihilated the Italian fascist battalion Fulmine in Trnovo. Fighting with German and Quisling forces continued into February and March, particularly across the Trnovski Gozd region.

### March–April 1945: Final German Offensive and Liberation Operations
During the last German offensive on the Slovenian Littoral (March 19–April 3), the division suffered heavy losses while engaging in particularly hard battles around Cerkno, Kozja Stena, Vojsko, Mrzla Rupa, Gornja Trebuša, Šentviška Gora, and surrounding areas.

In the final liberation phase, as part of the Ninth Corps, the division advanced from the Grgar–Trnovo–Otlica–Col line, occupying Predmeja and Otlica on April 25. It reached the Karst on April 28, captured Repentabor and Dutovlje on April 29, and entered Villa Opicina (Opčine) during the night of April 29/30. Together with the Fourth Army, it participated in the liberation of Trieste, Monfalcone, Udine, and Gorica.
