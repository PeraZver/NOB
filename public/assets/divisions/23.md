## Operations

The 23rd Serbian Division, initially named the 3rd Serbian Division, was formed on June 6, 1944, in Toplica. Shortly after its formation, it was renamed as an "assault" division. The division's early engagements included a successful night attack on June 21-22, 1944, against the Krajina Corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVuO) in the villages of Mozgovo, Crni Kal, and Rujište. On June 22, it attacked the Krajina, Timok, and Deligrad Corps of the JVuO on Bukovik, engaging approximately 3,000 Chetniks.

By June 28, the division had captured the Dobra Sreća mine and on June 30, decisively defeated the 3rd Battalion of the Bulgarian 63rd Regiment at Varnički Vrh near Knjaževac. Continuing its offensive, the division liberated Boljevac on August 12 and Knjaževac on September 4. It then became part of the 14th Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ) and participated in the liberation of Eastern Serbia.

In its advance towards the Danube, the division liberated Zaječar on September 7, 1944, in battles against strong German forces, Nedić's troops, and Chetniks, capturing significant quantities of weapons. Until September 22, it fought mainly against the German 1st Mountain Division in the areas of Zaječar, Negotin, and Prahovo, and from September 22, it cooperated with the 113th Rifle Division of the Red Army in the Kladovo, Brza Palanka, Bor, and other regions. On October 3, the division liberated Bor and Brestovačka Banja.

Following orders from the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ), the division was dispatched on October 13 to the area around the villages of Vrčin and Ripanj to secure the right flank of the 1st Army Group and the 4th Mechanized Corps of the Red Army during the Belgrade Operation. From October 17 to 20, it participated in the destruction of the German Corps Group "Stettner" in the region of Avala, Boleč, and Vrčin.

In November, the division engaged in battles on the left bank of the Western Morava against the German 104th and 7th SS "Prinz Eugen" Divisions and other units of Army Group E, as part of the 14th Corps near Čačak and Požega. In December, it was part of the Southern Operational Group of Divisions near Ljubovija and Tuzla. From January 1, 1945, the division was part of the 2nd Army of the Yugoslav Army, fighting on Ozren, liberating Gračanica on February 24, and Derventa on April 19. It was then part of the Una Operational Group of Divisions, fighting towards Karlovac on April 24 and Samobor on May 7, continuing until the end of the final operations.
