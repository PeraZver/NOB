## Operations

The 18th Slovenian Division was formed on September 14, 1943, in Zdenska Vas, and was composed of the 8th Slovenian Strike Brigade "Fran Levstik", the 9th Slovenian Strike Brigade, and the 10th "Ljubljana" Brigade. At its inception, the division had approximately 3,350 fighters. From October 3, 1943, until the end of the war, the division was consistently part of the 7th Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ).

Following the capitulation of Italy, the German High Command launched a significant intervention in the hinterland of the Gulf of Trieste. During the German "Rommel" offensive in October 1943, the division engaged in fierce battles against a superior enemy force and suffered considerable losses. Notably, the division fought intense battles near Brod na Kupi from October 18 to 24, in the region of Kočevska Reka, Mlaka, and Gotenica from October 27 to 31, and in the sectors of Grosuplje, Slična, Muljava, Krka, and Ilova Gora from November 1 to 4. The division also broke through German encirclements at Mokrec and Krim from November 8 to 10.

After the offensive, from early November 1943 to mid-February 1944, the division operated in the area of Gorski Kotar, where it collaborated with the 13th Division to attack Ustaše and German positions at Ravna Gora on December 7-8, Vrbovsko from December 15 to 23, and Hreljin on January 22-23.

Throughout 1944 and into early 1945, the units of the 18th Division conducted significant operations along the communication lines between Ljubljana and Rijeka, Ljubljana and Trieste, and Ljubljana and Novo Mesto. A particularly notable operation was the repeated destruction of the Štampet Bridge on September 26.

In early May 1945, the 18th Slovenian Division participated in the liberation of Dolenjska and Ljubljana.
