## Operations

The 21st Serbian Division, initially named the First Serbian Division, was formed on May 20, 1944, from the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Serbian Brigades. It was renamed the 21st Serbian Division on June 14, 1944, when it was designated as an "assault" division. The division played a significant role in the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II.

### Early Operations

On the day of its formation, the division, in cooperation with the 22nd Serbian Division, successfully dismantled the Jablanički, Južnomoravski, and Vardarski corps of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVUO). It engaged in significant battles against parts of the Južnomoravska and Rasinsko-toplička corps groups of the JVUO on June 3 and 4, 1944. By June 23, the division had liberated the towns of Brus and Aleksandrovac. During the Topličko-jablanička operation, the division bore the main burden of the fighting and successfully transitioned to counterattacks.

### Later Operations

In September 1944, the division was part of the Operational Group of Divisions and attempted an unsuccessful attack on Požega on September 13. However, it successfully liberated Gornji Milanovac on September 28-29. The division distinguished itself in the Belgrade Operation, fighting against the German corps group "Stettner," earning commendation from Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Partisans.

### Final Operations

On January 3, 1945, the division engaged in heavy fighting on the Srem Front against elements of the German 34th Army Corps. Later, in conjunction with the 48th Division, it liberated Vinkovci after a four-hour battle on April 13. The division, alongside the Sixth Proletarian Brigade, fought against the 47th and 65th German regiments of the 22nd Division, liberating Đakovo on April 16. It continued its advance with the First Proletarian Division, liberating Nova Gradiška and Nova Kapela on April 23, Okučane on April 25, and Novska on May 2, 1945.

Throughout its operational history, the 21st Serbian Division demonstrated significant combat effectiveness and played a crucial role in the liberation efforts during the latter stages of World War II in Yugoslavia.
