## Operations

The 27th East Bosnian Division was a significant military formation within the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II. Formed on October 10, 1943, in the liberated town of Tuzla, the division initially comprised the Second Krajina, 17th Majevica, and 18th East Bosnian Brigades, along with elements of the Birčanski NOP Detachment. Shortly after its formation, on October 24, 1943, the 19th Birčanski Brigade joined its ranks. Over time, the division underwent several changes in its composition, with the 18th Brigade leaving on December 2, 1943, and the Second Krajina Brigade departing on May 5, 1944. They were replaced by the 16th Muslim Brigade on March 15, 1944, and the 20th Romanija Brigade on May 19, 1944.

Operating primarily in Eastern Bosnia, the division was part of the Third Shock Corps of the NOVJ. Its operations were characterized by dynamic engagements against German forces, including the 369th Legionnaire Division, the 7th SS Division, and from March 1944, the 13th SS Division "Handschar." The division faced continuous operations from German and Axis-aligned forces, including units from the NDH and Chetnik formations.

In October 1943, the division captured Sokolac and later, during the Schneesturm offensive in December, attacked Breza and took Vareš. In January 1944, it recaptured Vareš and participated in an assault on Tuzla. The division suffered losses, including the deaths of national heroes Veljko Lukić Kurjak, commander of the 17th Brigade, on December 25, 1943, and Pavle Goranin, the division's political commissar, on January 2, 1944.

The division continued to engage in fierce battles throughout 1944, including actions in Han Pijesak, Sokolac, Rogatica, Vlasenica, and Srebrenica. A significant achievement came on September 17, 1944, when the division successfully liberated Tuzla. Following the Red Army's advance into the Great Morava Valley on October 10, 1944, the division's operational area gained strategic importance as a potential withdrawal route for German Army Group E. In November 1944, the division engaged in intense battles against this group and later faced the main Chetnik forces during their offensive in Eastern Bosnia in December 1944.

The division's operations continued into 1945, with significant engagements in Vlasenica in January and in the Drina and Bosna Valleys during February and March. During the Sarajevo Operation in April 1945, the division played a crucial role by encircling the German 363rd Regiment of the 181st Division on Romanija. The division's final wartime operation was the destruction of an Ustaše group fortified in Bosnian Posavina, culminating in the liquidation of the last Ustaše stronghold on May 25, 1945.
