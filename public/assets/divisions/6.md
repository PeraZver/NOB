## Operations

The 6th Lika Proletarian Shock Division, named after the renowned scientist Nikola Tesla, was a prominent unit of the Yugoslav Partisan movement during World War II. Formed on November 22, 1942, by the order of the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ), the division initially comprised the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Lika Brigades. It was part of the 1st Croatian Corps until November 11, 1943, and subsequently joined the 1st Proletarian Corps for the remainder of the war.

### Initial Operations (1942-1943)
Shortly after its formation, the division participated in operations in the lower Una River area, targeting Italian, Ustaše, and Chetnik forces in Lika and northern Dalmatia. During the initial phase of the Fourth Enemy Offensive, the division successfully engaged strong Italian forces, inflicting heavy losses in the Lapačko field. Alongside the 8th Kordun Division, it cleared all enemy garrisons in Lika, except for Gospić.

### Operations in Bosnia and the Drvar Operation (1943-1944)
In November 1943, the division moved to Bosnia, engaging in intense combat against occupying forces. It distinguished itself in the defense against the German airborne assault on Drvar on May 25, 1944, successfully protecting the Supreme Headquarters of NOV and POJ. This operation was crucial in safeguarding the Partisan leadership.

### Advance into Serbia and the Belgrade Operation (1944)
In September 1944, the division, together with the 1st Proletarian Division, advanced into Serbia, defeating the Chetnik 4th Assault Corps and weaker German units, liberating Valjevo and parts of western Serbia. During the Belgrade Operation in October 1944, the division played a significant role in overcoming resistance in the ministry buildings on Nemanjina Street, crossing the Sava River, and liberating Zemun.

### Sremski Front and Final Operations (1944-1945)
The division participated in the Sremski Front battles and, after breaking through, joined forces with the 21st Serbian Division to liberate Đakovo and Slavonski Brod. It continued to play a key role in the final operations for the liberation of Yugoslavia, entering Zagreb on May 9, 1945. The division was recognized as one of the most combat-effective units of NOV and POJ and was officially designated as a proletarian division on March 19, 1944, in honor of its achievements.
