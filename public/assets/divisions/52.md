## Operations

The 52nd Kosovo-Metohija Division was formed on February 8, 1945, comprising the First, Second, and Fourth Kosovo-Metohija Brigades. This division was notable for including members from all nationalities within Kosovo and Metohija, reflecting the diverse ethnic composition of the region.

Shortly after its formation, from February 10 to February 23, 1945, the division engaged in significant combat operations against the Ballists in the Drenica region. These operations were successful, inflicting heavy losses on the Ballists, with 258 killed and 558 captured.

Throughout the remainder of World War II, the division continued its operations against remaining Ballist forces and other enemy units. It played a crucial role in consolidating the organs of people's government and strengthening the unity and brotherhood among Albanians, Serbs, and Montenegrins in Kosovo and Metohija.

The division remained under the command of the Operational Staff of the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments for Kosovo and Metohija until the end of the war. By May 1, 1945, the division's strength had increased to 7,013 fighters, demonstrating its growth and continued commitment to the liberation efforts in the region.
