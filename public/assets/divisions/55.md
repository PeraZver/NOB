## Operations

The Kumanovo Division of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ) was established in mid-October 1944 near the village of Žegljane, close to Kumanovo. Upon its formation, the division comprised the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Macedonian Brigades, with Metodi Popovski appointed as its commander.

Initially, the division operated in the region of Kačanik Gorge and along the Kumanovo-Kriva Palanka road. These strategic locations were crucial for controlling movements and supply lines in the area. The division played a significant role in the liberation efforts of Kumanovo, a key town in the region, and was actively involved in the battles around Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.

As the division continued its operations, it became part of the First Macedonian-Kosovo Corps, later known as the Sixteenth Corps of the NOVJ. This integration into a larger corps structure allowed the division to coordinate more effectively with other units in the broader campaign to liberate Yugoslavia from Axis occupation.

Despite its significant contributions to the liberation efforts, the Kumanovo Division was short-lived. It was disbanded in early December 1944, just a few months after its formation. The fighters from the division were reassigned to other military units, continuing their participation in the struggle for liberation in different capacities.
