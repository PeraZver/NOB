# Knin Operation, 1944

The "Knin Operation" was an offensive by which the Yugoslav Partisans liberated Knin in December 1944, defeating the Axis forces and completing the takeover of Dalmatia. The "Knin Operation" in the narrow sense includes the fighting for the city of Knin itself and its immediate surroundings (25 November - 5 December), and in the broader sense, the operation to liberate the wider area of Dalmatia that began on 13 September. Given the heavy losses on both sides, it is considered the largest battle in the history of Dalmatia.

## Strategic Background

The idea of the German High Command in the fall of 1944, following the massive strategic shift caused by the Soviet advance and the defection of Romania and Bulgaria, was to withdraw the 118th Fighter and 264th Infantry Divisions, the 92nd Motorized Brigade and the 1st "Brandenburg" Regiment from the Dalmatian Front and make them available to the 2nd Panzer Army to fight against the 3rd Ukrainian Front of the Red Army. This forced the German Army Group "E" to evacuate large portions of the Balkans. The front line from Gacka to the Zrmanja mouth was to be taken over by three legionary divisions: 369th ("Devil"), 373rd ("Tiger") and 392nd ("Blue"). The German High Command ordered a withdrawal from the Adriatic coast to establish a new, shorter defensive position known as the "Green Line". Knin was designated a crucial fortress to anchor this line, which stretched from the Velebit and Dinara mountains toward Bosnia.

However, the offensive of the 8th Corps hindered and preempted these plans: during September, parts of the 118th Division were destroyed on Brač, and parts of the 369th Division on Pelješac. The 369th  Division suffered its heaviest defeat at the hands of the 26th Dalmatian Division on 22 October in Vukov Klanac near Metković. During the withdrawal from Šibenik on 3 November, the 893rd Regiment of the 264th Division was defeated on the way to Drniš.

In such a situation, faced with strong pressure, the Southeast Command had to abandon the withdrawal of the 264th Division and assign it the task of defending Knin. The 8th Corps Headquarters attempted a wide sweep of Knin, counting on a possible attempt to withdraw the Germans from Knin as well. However, it encountered strong resistance. The Germans decided on a persistent defense, determined to keep Knin at all costs as the westernmost fortification on their imagined front line.

## Military Unit Numbers and Order of Battle

The Battle of Knin was a conventional engagement pitting the Partisans' highly motivated, numerically superior corps against a collection of German, Ustaše, and Chetnik forces tasked with holding the crucial defensive line.

### I. Partisan Forces (Yugoslav People's Liberation Army - NOVJ)

The main Partisan formation was the 8th Dalmatian Corps, commanded by **Petar Drapšin**.

### II. Axis Forces

The Axis defense was concentrated in the German XV Mountain Corps, commanded by General **Gustav Fehn**.

| Formation | Estimated Strength & Equipment | Key Sub-Units Involved |

## Timeline of the Knin Operation

The operation lasted over a month, concluding with the destruction of the main Axis defensive formations in Dalmatia.

| Date Range | Phase | Key Events and Unit Movements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Late Oct 1944** | **Strategic Withdrawal** | German forces evacuate the coast and retreat to Knin to establish the new "Green Line" defense. |
| **7 Nov – 15 Nov** | **Initial Battles** | From 7 to 15 November, the first phase of the attack on Knin took place, in which the 19th division operated in the direction of Gračac, 9th division from the direction of Bosansko Grahovo, the 26th division south of Knin, and the Knin fortifications themselves were attacked by 20th divisions from the west. The Germans successfully repelled the attack on the city with a persistent defense, and regained the lost communications to the north and northwest with counterattacks. |
| **November 17** | **Strategic Withdrawal** | On November 17th, General Fehn moved his headquarters to Bihać. He evacuated the demoralized Ustasha from the Knin area. Homeguard Forces and handed over immediate command of the defense to General **Alois Windisch**, commander of the 264th Infantry Division. Chetniks under the command of **Momčilo Đujić** in the last phase of the Knin operation left the German front near Knin and were transferred to the area of Karlovac. The entire area of Knin and key points on communications are carefully fortified with a connected system of trenches, bunkers, infantry obstacles and minefields. |
| **25 Nov – 1 Dec** | **Main Assault of 8th Corps** | Noticing that the enemy had the intention of persistently defending Knin, the headquarters of the 8th Corps drew up a new plan of attack. According to this plan, the 20th division will attack from the east on the city and on the northern communication, the 19th division from the west on the city and on the northwestern communication, the 26th division, reinforced with tank companies, will attack the city and advanced fortifications from the south, while the 9th division should intercept and destroy the German units that would eventually withdraw from Knin. The attack on the 20th Division sector began on 25 November, and on the 19th and 26th Division sectors on 26 November at dawn. In all sectors, the 8th Corps units advanced very slowly, breaking extremely strong and persistent enemy resistance. Day and night attacks and counterattacks took place with varying success and with significant losses on all parts of the front. Dissatisfied with the pace of the advance, Commander Drapšin brought in the last reserves on the morning of 1 December.  |
| **2/3 Dec** | **The Fall of Knin** | The German defense began to break on the evening of 2 December. The next day at around 8 am the units of the 20th division attacking from the east and the 19th division attacking from the west joined immediately north of the city and closed the ring around Knin. At the same time, the 26th Division was invading the southern part of the city and the remaining German forces were left to try to form strike groups and try to save themselves by breaking through. Most of it was destroyed in the city itself. On December 3, at 11 o'clock in the afternoon, Knin was liberated. The German defense was almost completely destroyed, and division commander Windisch managed to break through to the north, where he linked up with Chetnik units and with them broke through to southern Lika during the following days. |
| **5 Dec – 9 Dec** | **Final Battles and Pursuit** | Partisan forces pursue the retreating Axis remnants north toward Lika and Bihać, consolidating control over Dalmatia. The "catastrophe" was only prevented from becoming a total rout because Partisans halted the offensive shortly after, concentrating forces elsewhere. |
