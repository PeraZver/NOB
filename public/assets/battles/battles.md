Battle markers show the locations of major military engagements. Click on any marker to see detailed information about the battle.

## Filtering Battles

When using the year and month filters, only battles that were **ongoing** during the selected time period are displayed. For example:
- If a battle started in January 1944 and ended in March 1944
- Selecting April 1944 will **not** show this battle (it had already ended)
- Selecting December 1943 will **not** show this battle (it hadn't started yet)
- Selecting January, February, or March 1944 **will** show this battle

This allows you to see which battles were actively being fought during any specific month of the war.
