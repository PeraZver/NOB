The 8th  Dalmatian Shock Corps was a corps of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia formed on October 7, 1943 by order of the Supreme Commander of the NOV and POJ Josip Broz Tito from the 9th, 19th, 20th and 26th Divisions and the Middle-Dalmatian, Knin, Dinaric, Moseć-Svilaja, Seget-Marina, Imotski, Makarska, Mosor, Neretva, Grahov-Peulj, Glamoč and Livno partisan detachments.

On October 24, 1943, by order of the NOV and POJ Supreme Headquarters, the NOVJ Navy was temporarily subordinated to the 8th Corps Headquarters.

The first corps commander was Pavle Ilić Veljko, then Vlado Ćetković, and after his death in October 1944, Petar Drapšin. The political commissars of the corps were Ivan Kukoč, until January 25, 1944, and then Boško Šiljegović, until the end of the war.
