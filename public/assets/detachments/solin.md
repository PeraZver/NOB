# Solin Partisan Detachment

## Formation
Solin NOP detachment was formed on August 11, 1941, on Bili Kuk above Solin.

At the invitation of the Local Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia for Solin, 215 members of the Communist Party, candidates, SKOJ members and sympathizers, mainly workers of the Solin basin, reported to the detachment on August 10, 1941. Due to the lack of weapons, a detachment of 72 fighters organized in three platoons was formed, while 20 fighters were supposed to join the Split detachment, and 13 fighters to go to the Kaštela-Trogir detachment, which were formed at the same time. 

## Unfortunate start
Two platoons, after being formed, set off for Mount Dinara, while the third with the detachment's headquarters stayed behind to extract ammunition, and set off a little later, losing contact on the way. The first two platoons were attacked the next day, August 12, 1941, by Ustasha near the village of Sušci. Having lost two fighters, the main part of the detachment retreated. The following night, the entire Detachment returned to the Split region and remained there. 

## Diversions and sabotages in Solin area
In the bay of Solin, in very difficult conditions, the detachment continued with actions; acting in groups, it mainly carried out diversions and sabotage. 
It raided the Carabinieri station of Solin, destroyed telephone and telegraph lines in a length of 1 km along the Solin-Klis road (October 1/2, 1941). 
Again on October 4, it destroyed the telephone and telegraph lines near Rupotin. 
In honor of the day of the October Revolution, it destroyed the telephone and telegraph lines and attacked the Italian column on October 6 and 11 near Rupotin (9 Italian soldiers were killed and 3 wounded). 
In December, the Detachment has 86 fighters, who mostly lived in underground and above-ground stone digouts that, thanks to the unity of the people, were never discovered.
A group of Detachment fighters raided the Italian officers' canteen in Solin with hand grenades on January 18, 1942. Several Italian officers were wounded and killed. 
The detachment secured checkpoints and a channel that was established at the end of the year from Split, via Solin, to Moseć, Svilaja, Dinara and Mosor, through which new fighters, material and food were transferred and connections passed between the Provincial Committee located in Split and the free territory in Muć area. 

## Detachment conclusion
By order of the Headquarters of the IV operational zone, the detachment was transferred in two groups to Dinara (about 70 fighters) in April of 1942 and became part of the Dinara-Dalmatian NOP detachment, while part of the fighters were sent to partisan units around Livno. 
At the end of April, a group of Detachment fighters returned to the area of ​​the Solin basin and operated as the Solin Flying Platoon or Solin Flying Company until the capitulation of Italy, carrying out minor actions, raiding Solin and accepting new fighters and material from Split and neighboring regions, transferring it to free territory. More than once they organized the population to demolish communications, railroads, telephone and telegraph lines and transfer large quantities of materials. The Solin NOP detachment lived and fought in the Solin basin for eight months next to the strong occupation forces, which could not, despite daily pursuits, discover it.
