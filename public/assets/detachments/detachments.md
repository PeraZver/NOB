# Formation and Early Operations of Partisan Detachments in Occupied Yugoslavia (1941)

## Overview

Partisan Detachments, officially known as **People’s Liberation Partisan (NOP) Detachments of Yugoslavia**, were the earliest military formations of the People’s Liberation Movement during World War II. They represented the initial form of armed resistance and remained in existence even after the creation of the People’s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ) in November 1942.

Unlike brigades, which were mobile operational units, partisan detachments were primarily territorial formations, focused on fighting within specific regions.

## Formation and Early Development

The first detachments were formed from small guerilla and combat groups created in June 1941.

- The first partisan unit in Yugoslavia was the **Sisak Partisan Detachment**, formed on 22 June 1941 near Sisak.
- Strength varied by region:
  - In **Serbia, Montenegro, Lika, Banija, Kordun, and Bosanska Krajina**, some detachments grew to **over 1,000 fighters**.
  - In **Dalmatia**, several larger detachments were formed.
  - In **Gorski Kotar and the Croatian Littoral**, partisan camps were established.
  - In **Slovenia**, early units were smaller companies of **20–30 fighters**.

By the end of the war, approximately **250 partisan detachments** had been formed.

### Structure

Detachments were organized on a territorial principle and commanded by a headquarters composed of commander, political commissar and their deputies. Typically, a detachment included 3–4 battalions,  consisting of 3–4 companies. Initially, the detachments were equipped with weapons of the former Yugoslav Army, collected after its capitulation. Later, they were supplied primarily through captured enemy weapons.

This structure was formally defined at the **Stolice Conference on 26 September 1941**.

Partisan detachments employed guerrilla warfare tactics, including:

- Ambushes, night raids, sabotage and diversion operations, 
- Destruction of communication lines, railways and infrastructure used by occupying force
- Disruption of local administrative structures

Through offensive action and mass participation, they quickly established liberated territories during the early months of the uprising.

## Transition to Higher Formations

As the uprising developed into a broader national war, the need arose for more mobile and larger military formations not tied to specific territories.

- Late 1941: Formation of brigades
- Late 1942: Formation of divisions and corps

Many brigades were formed directly from existing partisan detachments.  

Even after the creation of larger units, territorial detachments remained an important and active component of the armed struggle.
