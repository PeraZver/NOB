# Split Partisan Detachment

## Formation

The Split Partisan Detachment was established on 11 August 1941 in Splitsko polje (Plokita area) by decision of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia for Dalmatia. It initially comprised three platoons of 22 fighters each, a total of 66 fighters. The fighters were all members of KPJ and SKOJ, mostly workers, football players of RNK Split and former members of the Split Combat Detachment who had already undergone military training. The commander was **Đordano Borovčić-Kurir**, the political commissar **Alfred Santini**, and the platoon commanders were **Andro Račić**, **Tomo Blašković**, and **Mate Šarić**. A Spanish Civil War veteran and a KPH member **Mirko Kovačević–Lala** accompanied them as the commander of all Partisan detachments in Dalmatia. They gathered at the assembly point in Plokite, from where they departed into the hinterland.

## The Failure of the First Split Detachment

Their route led through Kučine, across Mosor, through Kotlenice, and toward the eastern hamlets of Dicmo. They were supposed to rest overnight in a hideout. According to the plan, during the night of 12–13 August, the Split and Solin detachments were to move together toward the Sinj field, join the Sinj Partisan Detachment, cross the Cetina River, and reach the Kamešnica area.

However, due to inexperience, poor organization, the plan fell behind schedule. On 11 August, the Split Partisan Detachment set out toward Zagora, but not in full strength: the 2nd Platoon got lost, and the 1st and 3rd platoons waited two hours for it. As a result, the 2nd Platoon was dissolved, and 44 fighters continued the march.

Instead of spending one night on the slopes of Mosor, they marched for two nights. They hid in a wooden enclosure near the hamlet of Hercegovci, where they rested. Cut off from the other detachments, with whom they were supposed to link up, they were forced to make decisions on their own. During the night of 13/14 August, they followed the planned route, taking side paths along Kamešnica toward Košute and the Cetina. For two days, they advanced toward their objective on Dinara, moving mostly at night. The hasty preparations and poor organization became evident when they failed to meet the guides who were supposed to lead them. They decided to continue despite having no supplies left.

On 14 August, the third day of the march, they reached the village of Košute near Trilj, starving, with feet wounded from inadequate footwear, and entirely out of water. Two fighters, **Vladimir Marković–Inđo** and **Veljko Neškovčin**, went into the village on reconnaissance and to obtain food and water, but were met with distrust. After leaving the village, a villager confronted them with a rifle; Marković and Neškovčin opened fire.  

The gunfire alerted Italian Blackshirts from Sinj armed with a machine gun, Croatian Home Guards, gendarmes from nearby Trilj, and soon motorized Ustasha and Italian units arrived from Sinj. The battle lasted the entire day. The commander Mirko Kovačević was killed among the first, which significantly affected the morale of the fighters. With nightfall, the detachment attempted a breakthrough. Some fighters managed to escape; others were captured.

Alongside Kovačević, three more fighters were killed during the firefight. During the capture, three additional fighters were executed. The fallen included:  
**Vinko Blaić**, **Ante Brajčić**, 1st Platoon commander **Andro Račić–Latiša**, 3rd Platoon commander **Mate Šarić**, **Ivan Uvoda**, and **Ljubo Zorica**.

A total of 25 fighters were captured, among them the severely wounded **Vinko Paić–Ožić**. Thirteen fighters managed to break out and return to Split:  **Tonči–Trobo Alfirević**, **Ante Anđelić**, **Andrija Bužančić**, **Mate Hajduković**, **Josip Jadrić**, **Ivan–Iso Jukić**, **Vladimir Inđo Marković**, **Svemir Matutinović**, **Veljko Neškovčin**, **Paško Srdelić**, **Veljko Subota**, **Nenad Vukadin**, and **Božo Šarić**.

All the captured fighters were taken to the prison in Sinj, where they remained for 12 days. They were chained, interrogated, and tortured. In the prison, **Vinko Paić–Ožić** died from beatings. For the purpose of the trial, a special court from Mostar arrived in Sinj. In a brief trial, three fighters were pardoned and released: **Jerko Čerina**, **Martin Gabričević**, and **Nikola Matković**. The rest were found guilty and sentenced to death. They were collectively executed on 26 August 1941 in the area of Ruduša near Sinj:

- 21 fighters of the Split Partisan Detachmen:  
  commander of the detachment **Đordano Borovčić-Kurir**, political commissar **Alfred Santini**, **Ivan Antonini**, **Nebojša Borozan**, **Mirko Dujmić**, **Branko Duplančić**, **Dušan Frua**, **Petar Jelaska**, **Jozo–Josip Krstulović**, **Jozo–Josip Markotić**, **Ivan Marković**, **Marin Matković**, **Vjekoslav Ozretić**, **Josip–Jozo Petrić**, **Ante Popović**, **Josip Radetić**, **Dragutin Rogulj**, **Tadija Škopljanac**, **Ante Torkar**, **Davor Urlić**, and **Ante Zelić**.  

- 2 fighters of the Solin Partisan Detachment:  
  **Ante Katić** and **Ante Čerina–Tonko**; they were not present at the battle site but were imprisoned together with the Split fighters in Sinj.  

- The villager **Šimun Stojanac** from Dicmo, who was accused of delivering weapons to the Solin partisans.

## The Second Split Partisan Detachment

In early November 1941, a new Split NOP Detachment was formed, consisting of about 20 fighters, all members of strike groups and the KPJ. On 9 November 1941, a group of its fighters carried out a daring attack in the city center—throwing hand grenades at an Italian infantry detachment accompanied by the military band of the *Cacciatori delle Alpi* Division, wounding 24 Italian soldiers.

Due to severe enemy reprisals, the Detachment was officially formalized only at the end of December 1941. In February 1942, it merged into the newly established Mosor NOP Detachment.

## The Third Split Partisan Detachment

A third incarnation of the Split NOP Detachment was established on 15 March 1943 by order of the Headquarters of the NOP Detachment Group for Dalmatia, in the Muć–Lećevica area. It consisted of three battalions:

- 1st Battalion – primarily fighters from the Trogir and Kaštela partisan groups  
- 2nd Battalion – composed of the Šibenik–Drniš partisan company  
- 3rd Battalion – formed from the Bukovac–Promina partisan company  

Reinforced by new recruits from across central Dalmatia, the Detachment reached about 400 fighters by mid-April, making it the largest partisan unit in central Dalmatia at the time. Its primary mission was to defend the free Muć territory and mobilize new fighters following the departure of the 9th Dalmatian Division toward the Neretva and Herzegovina.

### Early Operations

Shortly after its formation, the Detachment defended free territory but was pushed toward the slopes of Dinara by superior Italian and Ustasha forces. Operating from these positions, it launched attacks on Chetnik, Ustasha, and Home Guard garrisons attempting to eliminate NOP units between Knin and Sinj after the withdrawal of major NOVJ formations.

- Late March 1943: Two battalions expelled Chetnik and Ustasha forces from Otišić and Maovice, and clashed with Ustasha units on the Sinj–Vrlika road.  
- Both battalions then advanced toward Knin Krajina and Kosovo, capturing Mala Polača on 2 April 1943.  
- On 4 April, the 3rd Battalion, alongside one battalion of the 10th Krajina Brigade, attacked Chetnik forces at Vrpolje near Knin. Fierce fighting continued into the next day, costing the battalion 21 killed and 7 wounded.

### Expansion of Operations

The main body of the Detachment fought Italian and Chetnik forces in the Knin region until mid-April. Meanwhile on the coast, the 1st Battalion supported the formation of the Trogir and Šibenik partisan companies.

On 23/24 April 1943, all three battalions carried out coordinated attacks on Italian garrisons in the Kaštela region, including:

- Partial destruction of the gun battery in Kaštel Lukšić  
- Burning of the railway station in Kaštel Gomilica  
- Destruction of the municipal building and military stables in Kaštel Sućurac

Subsequent actions included:

- 27 April 1943: The 2nd and 3rd Battalions expelled Ustasha forces from Kljake, then advanced to the Drniš–Šibenik area.  
- 1 May 1943: Defeat of the Ustasha garrison in Pokrovnik, stabilizing free territory in central Dalmatia.

### Summer 1943

During June, parts of the Detachment conducted operations along the coast:

- Disabling an Italian seaplane near Seget  
- Attacking an Italian motorboat near Trogir  
- Derailing an Italian armored train on the Split–Drniš railway  
- Repeated sabotage of the Split–Drniš and Perković–Šibenik railways  
- Liberation of Marina from Italian control  
- Continued engagements with Italian, Ustasha, and Chetnik forces  
- Acceptance of larger groups of new volunteers  

At the end of August, the 3rd Battalion joined the 1st Dalmatian Brigade.

### Italy’s Capitulation and Aftermath

Following Italy’s capitulation in September 1943, the Detachment provided experienced fighters to newly formed Dalmatian units. In mid-September, the remaining personnel joined the Split Brigade, which in mid-October became the 4th Brigade of the 9th Division.
