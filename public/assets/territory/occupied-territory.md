# Yugoslavia Occupied Territories - April 1941

In April 1941, Axis forces invaded and rapidly defeated the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whose forces surrendered after 10 days fighting. After the surrender, the Axis powers dismantled Yugoslavia and divided its territory among themselves and newly created puppet regimes.

### Germany

- Annexed **northern Slovenia**.
- Established direct military occupation over a reduced **Serbian state**.
- Exercised strong influence over the newly proclaimed **Independent State of Croatia (NDH)** (10 April 1941).

### Italy

Italy expanded significantly:

- Annexed remaining parts of **Slovenia**, large portions of **Dalmatia**, most Adriatic islands, and the **Bay of Kotor**.
- Occupied Kosovo.
- Established the **Italian Governorate of Montenegro**.
- Formally received the kingship role in the NDH (though with limited real power), and excercised its military adminstration in its zones of influence.

### Hungary

Hungary occupied and later annexed **Bačka**, **Baranja**, **Međimurje** and **Prekmurje**.
These annexations were part of territorial revisions of treaties from 1918., promised by Germany for Hungarian effort in invasion of Yugoslavia.


### Bulgaria

On **19 April 1941**, Bulgarian forces occupied most of modern **North Macedonia** and parts of **eastern Serbia**.
On **14 May 1941**, Bulgaria formally annexed Greek **Western Thrace** and eastern Macedonia (Aegean Province).


### Independent State of Croatia (NDH)

The territory of modern-day **Croatia** and all of **Bosnia and Herzegovina** was administered by the puppet state of NDH, with the following border agreements:
- **13 May 1941** – Border agreement with Germany defined the NDH–Third Reich frontier on Styria in Slovenia.
- **18 May 1941 (Treaties of Rome)** – NDH ceded most of **Dalmatia**, parts of **Gorski kotar** and large areas of the **Croatian Littoral**  to Italy.
- A **27 October 1941** agreement ceded southern Konavle (including Prevlaka and Gruda) to the Italian-annexed Bay of Kotor area.
- The Drava River formed the border, but Međimurje was occupied and retained by Hungary (with German backing) until 1945.
- Border with Serbia was defined on 7 June 1941 along the former Austro-Hungarian–Serbian frontier.  

Although NDH retained a limited coastline (e.g., Novi, Senj, Crikvenica, Karlobag, Kraljevica, and the stretch from Omiš to Dubrovnik), the territorial concessions included 5.380 square kilometers with around **400,000 inhabitants**, mostly Croats. 

The terriory of NDH was divided between italian and german spheres of influence following the demarcation line from the area of Žumberak in the north to Sandžak in the south. Italy divided its interest zone within NDH into three zones:

- The first was directly annexed, and was part of the Kingdom of Italy.
- The second and third were under Italian civil and military authority (especially after 7 September 1941).


### Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia

Germany established the **Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia** as a directly occupied military zone. It existed from **April 1941 to 1944** and was the only area in former Yugoslavia placed under full German military administration. It included most of **central Serbia**, northern **Kosovo**, and the **Banat**

Supreme authority rested with the German Military Commander in Serbia, while the Serbian collaborationist government handled limited administrative tasks.

The harsh occupation system, territorial dismemberment, and political repression laid the groundwork for the rapid escalation of armed resistance and the emergence of a broad liberation movement.
